        <p><b>Is Vice Media the Members Only Jacket of the Media Industry?</b></p> <p><br></p> <p>Those of us of a certain age vividly remember Members Only. One day no one had heard</p> <p>&nbsp;of it, and the next day everyone - and I mean everyone - was wearing the jacket. &nbsp;However, Members Only did not actually come out of nowhere. &nbsp;The company (founded in 1975) was around for nearly a decade before an unpredictable chain of events caused it to</p> <p>&nbsp;become hot in the mid 80s. Then, just as quickly as it exploded, it died down. &nbsp;In no time, wearing Members Only was a sure way to tell the world you were out of touch and behind the times.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Vice Media runs the very real risk of following the exact same trajectory.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Like Members Only, Vice has been around for a while  since 1994 to be exact. &nbsp;For many</p> <p>&nbsp;years it languished in obscurity. &nbsp;An occasional article or series would give it a little visibility beyond the clubby world of the media industry. &nbsp;But in the last 2-3 years Vice has exploded. It seems like there is hardly a corner of the world or a sensational</p> <p>&nbsp;story that has not been touched by a Vice reporter. &nbsp;One would struggle to find a Twitter feed or a Facebook wall that is</p> <p><b>not</b> littered with shared</p> <p>&nbsp;Vice articles and videos.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Most telling is how much Vice has become the main topic of discussion inside Old Media</p> <p>&nbsp;executive offices and boardrooms. &nbsp;As someone who works with print, TV, and online media executives, I hear the word Vice used on a daily basis. &nbsp;Common uses of the word Vice include:</p> <p>·</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why cant our editors exhibit more of an edgy Vice-style voice?</p> <p>·</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wish our Sales team could master native advertising the way Vice has.</p> <p>·</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If we opened an office in Williamsburg, Brooklyn would we be able to recruit fresh young Vice-like talent?</p> <p>·</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We cant reach the Vice audience because nobody on our management team has the magnetism and charisma of Shane Smith.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Vice is serious. &nbsp;They are hungry, fierce, and on the attack. &nbsp;However, the question</p> <p>&nbsp;nobody seems to be asking is whether Vices position is sustainable. &nbsp;Will they continue to grow and threaten Big Media or will they implode and fade away like Members Only?</p> <p><br></p> <p>Vice has a few things working against it. &nbsp;First, its core demographic is getting older.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of Vices rise is attributable to an uncanny ability to capture the attention of Millennials. &nbsp;There is probably no company on earth better than Vice at reaching this seemingly unreachable demographic. &nbsp;However, Millennials are getting older. &nbsp;Will they</p> <p>&nbsp;still want to munch on the Twinkie and Fritos diet of Vice content when they acquire a taste for Fois Gras? &nbsp;Millennials wont wake up one day and simply decide they would rather read the commodities report in the Financial Times rather than watch a video</p> <p>&nbsp;of a rock band made up of heroin-addicted skateboard punks from Somalia. &nbsp;This transition will take place as they get jobs, get married and get on with their lives.</p> <p><br></p> <p>It is believed that Winston Churchill once said, If you are not a liberal at 25, you</p> <p>&nbsp;have no heart. &nbsp;If you are not a conservative at 35, you have no brain. &nbsp;Vice is a business model that is all about nourishing the young heart. &nbsp;It is not equipped to satisfy a critical, well-informed, mature brain. &nbsp;Its content, however heartwarming, does</p> <p>&nbsp;not meet the needs of someone who wants to truly understand the implications and nuances of a serious news story.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Furthermore, the Vice business model is not very defensible. &nbsp;Sure, they have built a</p> <p>&nbsp;loyal and highly engaged audience. &nbsp;However, they do not have a secret formula that cannot be replicated (or at the very least simulated). &nbsp;They are competing against media companies that have deep pockets, massive scale, huge infrastructure, and expansive</p> <p>&nbsp;reach and distribution. &nbsp;While these media companies are largely on their heals, Vice cannot expect them to stay quiet. &nbsp;Nor can Vice maintain the hubris that they are insulated from Old Media attacks. &nbsp;No matter how loudly Shane Smith calls the competition</p> <p>&nbsp;a bunch of bitches, he must accept that these bitches fight hard.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Millennials are not an alien race understood only by the young Aquavit-sipping employees</p> <p>&nbsp;who occupy Vices funky Williamsburg offices. &nbsp;While it has taken a while, most companies in media (and other industries) have started to become very effective at reaching and connecting with this audience. &nbsp;Vice does not have a monopoly on talent, resources</p> <p>&nbsp;or even ideas. &nbsp;While Vice is much more than a one trick pony  Old Media has figured out most of the tricks.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Vice will learn that there are just two types of companies in the world - Attackers and</p> <p>&nbsp;Defenders. &nbsp;Attackers are the scrappy, hungry new entrants seeking to disrupt the industry, take market share, and battle the establishment. &nbsp;Twenty years ago MTV was an attacker. &nbsp;Ten years ago Google was an attacker. &nbsp;Today, they are defenders, fending off</p> <p>&nbsp;new entrants and small startups trying to nibble away at their business. &nbsp;The goal of nearly every attacker is to one day become the defender. &nbsp;Some companies thrive as defenders (Apple), while others struggle (Microsoft). &nbsp; </p> <p><br></p> <p>Vice has unquestionably been the attacker and has inflicted some serious damage onto</p> <p>&nbsp;established media companies. &nbsp;However, due to its scale, audience size and deep pockets, Vice is transitioning into becoming a defender. &nbsp;As that transition happens the new attack will not only come from young media startups but also from well-funded and extremely</p> <p>&nbsp;powerful established media conglomerates. &nbsp;Does Vice have the resources, skills and experience to thrive as a defender?</p> <p><br></p> <p>Some industry analysts have pointed at Fusion (a joint venture between ABC/Disney and</p> <p>&nbsp;Univision) as a first shot in what is sure to be a war for the millennial eye balls. &nbsp;While Fusion is a great product and will have some success, it will not win the war. &nbsp;Other media companies are currently running Manhattan Projects to build more formidable</p> <p>&nbsp;weapons. &nbsp;The war is still young and the outcome is not decided. &nbsp;However, Vice should prepare itself to take casualties.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>Its not yet clear how Vice will respond to the attacks. &nbsp;The successful formula that</p> <p>&nbsp;got it to where it is today will need to be tweaked or possibly changed entirely. &nbsp;Vices investors have placed a lot of faith in its management team - a management team that curiously lacks anyone with business experience. &nbsp;The teams lack of business experience</p> <p>&nbsp;and knowledge has served them well as attackers. &nbsp;It freed them of constraints and allowed them to make bold decisions. &nbsp;As Vice becomes a defender, it will need to expand its leadership team to include some experienced leaders who understand more than just</p> <p>&nbsp;the creative side of building a media company.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Ultimately, the future of Vice will likely rest less on the strength of its editorial</p> <p>&nbsp;content and more on its ability to expand into new business models. &nbsp; What are the ways Vice can convert this unique relationship with millennials into new businesses? &nbsp;A very positive sign was their launch of Carrot Creative  a digital ad agency focused</p> <p>&nbsp;on millennials. &nbsp;However, launching an agency is not a radical idea. In fact, Old Media has been in the agency business for years. &nbsp;What are other business models Vice may want to explore? &nbsp;Should Vice launch a travel business to target millennials who want</p> <p>&nbsp;to visit the exotic locations of Vice reports? &nbsp;Should Vice launch a food delivery business to feed the kids who regularly enjoy the Munchies channel? &nbsp;Can Vices Motherboard create a tech event that puts Disrupt or SXSW to shame? &nbsp;There are countless ideas</p> <p>&nbsp;worth exploring, but doing so productively requires a blend of fresh creativity and business rigor.</p> <p><br></p> <p>To be clear  what Shane Smith has accomplished is very impressive. &nbsp;Beneath all the</p> <p>&nbsp;tattoos is a ruthless and brilliant leader who has done a masterful job of getting Vice to where it is today. &nbsp;Frankly, I would love to see Shane be the CEO of a few Old Media companies I know  he would certainly make a positive impact. &nbsp;However, the sustainability</p> <p>&nbsp;of Vice cannot rest on Shanes shoulders alone. &nbsp;He needs to diversify his organization and its business models. &nbsp;For Vice to avoid becoming a one-trick pony, Shane has to get into the media equivalent of the race horse breeding business.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Twenty years ago, many of the companies that we now call Old Media were in the same</p> <p>&nbsp;position as Vice. &nbsp;They were flying high and could do no wrong. &nbsp;MTV was the voice of its generation, Fox was a fourth network in a three network world, Wired was the future of the magazine industry, AOL was the forebearer of media convergence, and Sirius</p> <p>&nbsp;re-imagined the radio industry. While these companies all exist today, some reasonably successfully, they failed to maintain their meteoric trajectories. Most disappointing is that they failed to fully capitalize on the countless opportunities that were available</p> <p>&nbsp;to them. &nbsp;Ultimately, they did not evolve quickly enough, they stopped being sufficiently aggressive, and eventually became content with operating their businesses in survival mode.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Rather than ignoring Old Media, Vice should learn from it. &nbsp;Vice should adapt, evolve,</p> <p>&nbsp;and continually transform or one day it too will be referred to as Old Media.</p> <p><br></p> <p>The decline of Members Only was rapid and brutal. &nbsp;The company literally fell off the</p> <p>&nbsp;face of the earth. &nbsp;Vice is currently looking down from the very top of the mountain. &nbsp;Its a long way down and the drop can be painful and possibly deadly. &nbsp;Rather than building a fort at the top of the mountain, Vice needs to aggressively look for new peaks</p> <p>&nbsp;to conquer.</p> <p>?<br></p>
<p>DUBLIN, February 17, 2014- AYLIEN, Inc., a Dublin-based technology firm backed by SOS Ventures, this week announced the availability of its Text Analysis API, a suite of eight Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval and Machine Learning APIs that enable developers and news organizations to extract meaningful insights from nearly any document.</p><p></p><p>The concept of the Semantic Web is crucial to the evolution of the web in general, but existing technology hasnt kept up with that vision, founder Parsa Ghaffari said. In order to build the platform of the future, we need to build the technology to support that platform. It starts with giving developers and news organizations the tools they need to build platforms that adapt to the needs of their users. The Text Analysis API is the first step in building a web in which machines communicate with each other in meaningful ways.</p><p></p><p>AYLIENs Text Analysis API offers distinct advantages over existing solutions, most notably with automatic hashtag suggestions for social media platforms. The package consists of eight APIs, each with unique capabilities:</p><p></p><p>The Text Analysis API delivers highly relevant information at record speed, surfacing new information almost immediately after it appears on, for example, Wikipedia. Classification adheres to a universal standard, eliminating miscommunication between platforms. Using the API consists merely of creating a Mashape account and subscribing to the API through its homepage. Pricing is aggressive, and does not require long-term contracts. A plan is available to students, educators, and researchers free of charge for the first six months.</p><p></p><p>A demo of the Text Analysis API is available here, and an overview and FAQ section is available on our page.

<p>SEO and PR, once upon a time, existed as two different entities and offered different digital marketing features. Today, youll witness that this isnt any longer the case. Presently, SEO and PR now are working more closely together within a new integrated and evolved digital landscape. Murray Newlands co author of How to get PR for your Startup : Traction said I increasingly see the disciplines of PR and SEO working together. &nbsp;There are many similarities in skill sets of creating great content and reaching out other sites to develop relationships. SEO used to be a technical team all on its own, with the strong emergence of content marketing and Googles changes to its algorithm that has changed. </p><p></p><p>To start, Google started to place more importance on quality of the content, relevant content and premium sites linking to your site. &nbsp;Therefore, to appear high in Googles results pages, you currently have to write and share insightful and appealing content and get links from great sites. However, if you work in public relations, itll be something youre already familiar with. PR professionals target larger publications with great content linking to your site. &nbsp;These days, quality links and content has become the glue which binds search engine optimization and public relations together.</p><p></p><p>It isnt any secret that presently in 2014, engaging content which is targeted at the proper audience wont just boost brand awareness yet also inspire people to share what they have read around the Internet. After all, theyre the two main goals of any search engine optimization and public relations individual. Moreover, the connections which public relations experts make with impactful publishers and bloggers are a massive benefit for anybody working within search engine optimization. Thats why today you will see many PR and SEO execs working more closely with one another on a project. Put plainly, joint PR and SEO goals may develop stronger digital marketing plans which assist in ultimately spearheading brand visibility.</p><p></p><p>However, there are several specific activities which public relations teams may get involved in which may increase sales if search engine optimization aims are blended, and vice versa. Here are some examples:</p><p></p><p>These days, PR and SEO are blending their skillsets and working collectively together on joint tasks. One such task which is shared by both departments includes content management, and especially, content calendars. Content calendars, previously, would solely be utilized by public relations experts for scheduling and creating topics for stories. SEO professionals, now are integrating content calendars in their strategies for content marketing.</p><p></p><p>Content expert Cynthia Johnson states Content calendars in particular, really are important in assisting SEOs in keeping updated on scheduling enticing content ideas surrounding seasonal events. Seasonal occasions which are relevant to a client must be included inside a content calendar as it assists SEO professionals in planning ahead while coming up with creative subjects to blog about. Innovative PR events and stunts, in comparison, also can assist in generating major attention and links to an organization.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, content has become the glue that binds search engine optimization and public relations together.</p><p></p><p>As with any relationship, communication is critical. Therefore, as it will come to a search engine optimization department closely working with a public relations team, the two departments must communicate. Problems might arise as the two marketing channels perform the same task, yet do not keep one another updated with developments. Be certain you communicate while working on joint projects and do not wind up duplicating the workload.</p><p></p><p>Since SEO and public relations are one and same now, utilize that knowledge to locate better links to your site. Social media channels such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and a multitude of others are extremely important ways to gain incoming links which are based upon organic interest in your website. Links from prominent publications, of course, still are gold; however, it is a lot simpler to grow relationships with bloggers and additional social media users who have engaged, substantial readerships which make them a precious link to go after.</p><p></p><p>PR utilizes a various set of tools to grow trust and awareness, and you ought to learn how to make friends on the Internet with individuals which may help you. It is possible to piggyback on the prominence and trust of bloggers who attract an audience within an associated niche to yours to increase your SERPs. Provide complimentary samples to a Pinterest or Instagram mogul or blogger and allow them to discuss your product to their audience rather than spamming their comments to gain links. It is the only way which will work moving forward.</p>
<p>Apple Watch: What can you do with it?</p><p></p><p>Ive been lucky enough to get hold of an actual physical Apple Watch now since Friday. Ive worn it over the weekend and of course, played around with building an application. One of the interesting things about the Apple Watch is that many of the apps built that were available on day 1 have never been run on real hardware, except perhaps, those built by friends of Apple like Twitter! Whilst this isnt a definitive guide to the Apple Watch from a developers perspective, it is a list of questions I had and Im sure others have! I also found a great Ray Wenderlich post with WatchKit FAQs. Its worth noting that these are things Ive found out so far, I could be wrong and it will probably change in the future!</p><p></p><p>Ok, so this one is interesting... Your Apple Watch app acts like a separate process running on a separate device, however behind the scenes the OS runs a skeleton like version of your host application on the user's iPhone and the Apple Watch extension in tandem, both on the iPhone. This is all magic but, from what I can tell, its actually used for complex view rendering, networking and file sharing which is then sent to the watch. This also explains why you can only update the UI of the Apple Watch with a user's interaction or by using a timer, as the watch will have to ask the phone for more information.</p><p></p><p>As the above image shows, your watch extension is actually running on the host iPhone with parts of the UI being rendered by the Apple Watch. This has some interesting side effects, for example an NSNotification (an event like API) cannot be sent between your watch extension and your host application, since even though they are theoretically running on the device they arent the same process. To communicate back and forth between the two processes Apple provides an API for asking the host process to do some work. If your host process needs to do some long running work like computation, fetching a user's GPS location or similar you have to declare that youre running a background task. Interestingly however you can do pretty much whatever you want in the WatchKit extension, because its running on the phone. This piqued my interest as this includes networking, meaning I shouldnt have to ask the host application to do various, though probably small, API requests and essentially avoids me having to get into RPC territory. Heres an example Watchkit interface viewcontroller that implements WebSockets and doesnt call back to the host application at all; Im not sure WebSockets like this are a good idea, but it certainly shows what you can do!</p><p></p><p>Note carefully how I re-instantiate the WebSocket during view activation; whilst the code appears to be running on the iPhone, the process is not long lived. When the user looks away and their watch sleeps, your application is suspended and your view deallocated. Perhaps, then, a better solution for fast WebSocket like communication would be a long running socket in the host application with the Watch communicating with that application.</p><p></p><p>An example I immediately thought of was building an audio player, but how can I download and stream a super long piece of audio and where is it stored? When viewing a list of Instagrams for example, where are those images downloaded to? Since your WatchKit extension and the host application are on the same device, Apple allow you to share files and user defaults (preference files) via a secure container. In a basic sense, this is a folder that both apps have read-write permissions on.</p><p></p><p>Well, not in HTML, since theres no web view on the Apple Watch. However React Native and others are promising a generation of native code generating frameworks with a Javascript engine in the background that I suppose could run on the host application. So I guess its theoretically possible!</p><p></p><p>No. This is a strange one. You can add images, buttons and other new WatchKit type interactions, but theyre laid out in a grid like fashion. At the moment there is no custom drawing framework or way of doing completely custom interfaces.</p>

<p><strong>New Holland,&nbsp;PA&nbsp;(April&nbsp;29,&nbsp;2015) -- ?New Holland Sales Stable was convicted of animal cruelty today</strong>&nbsp;for an incident of horrific neglect that occurred at the auction on February 16, 2015. Judge Rodney Hartman and the District Court of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania found New Holland guilty of the two animal cruelty charges brought before the court by D.A. Christy Wilson for which the Judge imposed a fine of $750 for each count of animal cruelty for a total $1500 in fines.<br> <br> The case hinged on an investigation conducted by Animals' Angels that included video footage clearly showing a sheep with strong signs of hypothermia, flat on its side and barely alive, along with a goat that had something terribly wrong with its legs and was unable to get up. Both were thrown away like trash and left to die on a "dead pile", in the middle of other, already dead animals. Although auction personnel are supposed to monitor the premises for injured or sick animals, these appeared to have been deliberately discarded in their condition and were subsequently ignored.<br> <br> According to Animals' Angels, auction workers were moving animals next to the "dead pile" throughout the morning of the incident and in fact, a truck backed up to the same loading ramp and animals were moved right across the area, but not one of these auction employees attended to the suffering animals nor did they alert the auction vet or auction management.<br> <br> During the course of the trial Susan Martin, the Humane Officer for the Lancaster County SPCA, testified that David Kolb, the General Manager of New Holland Sales Stable admitted to her during questioning that no protocols were in place for monitoring the premises for injured animals and that the sheep and the goat had been brought in already the night before on one of three potential trucks.<br> <br> While the Judge explained his decision, he expressed his grave disappointment in the fact that the auction still lacked any sufficient supervision of its employees or effective emergency protocols.<br> <br> New Holland is one of the largest auctions on the East Coast and thousands of animals go through this sale every week and they are no strangers to controversy. This is not the first time New Holland has been found guilty based on evidence that Animals' Angels has provided. In 2007, the auction was&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://lancasteronline.com/news/sales-stable-fined-for-animal-cruelty/article_3692a814-5980-5df5-b460-e7690154ce6d.html">convicted of animal cruelty</a>&nbsp;based on an almost identical case wherein three sheep were left dying for hours without intervention or assistance by auction personnel. Since that conviction, Animals' Angels has been urging auction management to improve conditions and establish humane protocols, but the auction continues to turn a blind eye to the behavior of its employees and has yet to implement appropriate monitoring or euthanization procedures.<br> <br> While the convictions may be few at auctions such as New Holland, the incidents of mistreatment are anything but. "<em>We have been monitoring New Holland and similar auctions regularly for years,"</em>&nbsp;stated Sonja Meadows, president of Animals' Angels, Inc. <em>"To obtain cruelty charges at any auction is much more difficult than one would think, even when the neglect and abuse seem very clear. The cruelty laws are often different for livestock than they are for companion animals. Cases like the one we won today can only help change that. These animals deserve better."</em><br> <br> Added Meadows <em>"Not only do we hope that New Holland will finally learn that they cannot get away with treating animals so inhumanely, but we are confident that this latest victory in the fight against animal cruelty will be a beacon to other auctions who are committing the same crimes. The message is loud and clear: animal cruelty of any kind will not be tolerated."</em><br> <br> Sonja Meadows also had this to say: <em>"I'm thrilled that justice for these animals was secured today. I just hope this conviction will be the long overdue wake-up call for auction management and we finally see the much needed improvements for the animals at this auction. It is also our hope that law enforcement agencies will now make a more regular practice of visiting this auction to ensure that they are adhering to all regulations. Rest assured, whether that happens or not, Animals' Angels will be there, continuing to monitor this auction personally."</em><br> <br> <strong>To read AA's full report from the investigation conducted on 2/16/15,</strong><b>&nbsp;</b><strong><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.animalsangels.org/investigations/horses/new-holland-auction-new-holland-pa-2-16-15">please go here</a>.</strong><b><br> <strong>To see the video footage from AA's investigation, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbP_SPCOQHw">please go here</a>.</strong></b></p>  <p><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>  <p><b><u>About Animals' Angels, Inc</u>:</b><br> Animals' Angels Inc. is a 501 (c)(3) non-profit organization incorporated in Maryland with full-time investigators working in the United States.<br> <br> Our focus is on fighting animal cruelty and improving conditions for farm animals through investigations, public awareness campaigns, and education.<br> <br> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.animalsangels.org/">www.animalsangels.org</a><br>443-821-3343<br>info@animalsangels.org<br></p><p><br></p>
  <p>The majority of small and mid-sized businesses use social media to grow. And yet for many of these firms, deciding which of the sites to use, and how best to find clientele on them, remains a challenge.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>SocialCentiv, whose software-based service helps companies find new customers on Twitter, today released its evaluation of how five of the social media worlds most popular sites perform as marketing vehicles for small businesses.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>In addition to Twitter, SocialCentivs guide includes looks at the pluses and minuses of Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn and Pinterest.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>SocialCentivs conclusion: For many small businesses, Twitter delivers the most bang for the advertising buck.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Roughly <a href="https://www.marketingtechblog.com/2014-statistics-trends-businesses-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">80 percent</a> of small and mid-sized companies employ social media in their expansion efforts, said Bernard Perrine, co-founder and CEO of SocialCentiv. And yet a 2013 <a href="http://www.manta.com/resources/press/mantas-q1-smb-wellness-index-reveals-small-businesses-find-roi-in-social-media-but-struggle-with-facebook/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">study</a> found that nearly 60 percent of small business owners had received <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/meghancasserly/2013/04/17/why-small-businesses-are-losing-on-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">no return</a> on their investments in social networking. While that can be understandable, it is also unnecessary.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>A major reason why small businesses often find marketing value elusive on social media is the dizzying array of networking sites to choose from, Perrine said.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Dozens have sprung up, aimed at everyone from <a href="http://www.dontstayin.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">nightclub patrons</a> and <a href="https://zooppa.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">creative talent</a> to <a href="https://www.epernicus.com/network" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">research scientists</a>, <a href="http://www.hr.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">human resources</a> professionals and <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/account/login" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">knitters and crocheters</a>.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Optimally, for time-pressed entrepreneurs, it often makes more sense to research which site or sites their customers frequent, and focus their efforts there. Which will you focus on? Here is the skinny on the most popular</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><b>Facebook: Prominent, but pricey</b></p>  <p>For many small businesses, the answer to where their customers are hanging out in the social media landscape will, at first blush, appear to be Facebook.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Facebooks more than <a href="https://zephoria.com/social-media/top-15-valuable-facebook-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1.39 billion</a> active users spend an average of about 20 minutes on the site per visit. About 48 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 34 check Facebook when they wake up, according to Statistic Brain.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Around seven out of every 10 Internet <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/a-primer-on-facebook-user-statistics-2014-9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">users</a> in the United States is on Facebook, Perrine said. The site is the biggest, most dominant player in social media.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Another advantage of Facebook is that advertisers can target would-be customers based on a variety of criteria, such as an individuals location, gender, interests and relationship status.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The flip side, Perrine noted, is that the marketing landscape on Facebook is getting crowded. The site had <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/23/facebook-usage-time/?ncid=rss" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1.5 million</a> advertisers in the summer of 2014. And as of late 2013, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/18/facebook-smb-25-m/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">one million</a> of its advertisers were small and mid-sized businesses.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>At least one observer has <a href="http://www.business2community.com/facebook/will-facebook-marketing-reach-saturation-point-01113296" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">wondered</a> whether Facebook is reaching the point of advertising saturation, where marketing efforts become increasingly difficult as an overload of companies try to reach the same customer base, Perrine said.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Making matters worse, Facebook is effectively killing off organic, or unpaid, reach by corporate marketers  ensuring they must pay to share their messages with the sites members. In response, <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/nate_elliott/14-11-17-facebook_has_finally_killed_organic_reach_what_should_marketers_do_next" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Forrester Research</a> has urged brands to stop making Facebook the center of (their) relationship marketing efforts.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>As has been noted <a href="http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/09/24/social-media-advertising" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">elsewhere</a>, Facebook knows it has the biggest user base in social media, and its advertising prices are starting to reflect that, Perrine said. As the head of a small business myself, I can understand why other entrepreneurs could have a hard time achieving much of a return on investment from marketing on Facebook.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><b>Google+: Where are the members?</b></p>  <p>This social network is a bit of an odd duck. Although it boasts in the neighborhood of 2.2 billion user profiles, one <a href="http://kevinanderson.nl/how-many-people-are-publicly-using-google-plus/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">study</a> found that only 9.9 percent of those profiles have any content that has been posted publicly.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>It gets stranger still. Another researcher <a href="https://ello.co/dredmorbius/post/nAya9WqdemIoVuVWVOYQUQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">estimated</a> in January 2015 that the service had only four million to six million active posters to date.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Nobody is using Google+, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-active-users-2015-1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Business Insider</i></a> wrote in reporting what those two researchers had discovered.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Since its inception in 2011, Google+ has had a user base made up of younger, technology-friendly <a href="http://www.threegirlsmedia.com/2015/04/07/social-media-marketing-statistics-google/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">men</a>. That can make it attractive for companies that could find value in that demographic, such as emerging technology firms that seek an audience willing to take a flyer on new software or hardware systems, Perrine said.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Aside from niche marketers like that, I have difficulty seeing the value for small businesses of spending marketing dollars on Google+, he added. There are simply too many mysteries about the networks user base that need clarifying first.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><b>LinkedIn: Favorite for B2B marketers</b></p>  <p>Like Google+, LinkedIn is an odd duck  albeit in a good way.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>With 300 million-plus active <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141118182103-28964915-social-media-user-statistics-age-demographics-for-2014" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">users</a>, LinkedIns niche is the professional audience. This gives it an <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/linkedin-as-a-marketing-and-brand-platform-2014-9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">edge</a> in in users that are college educated (38 percent) and between the ages of 30 and 49 (representing 27 percent of U.S. Internet users in that span).</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>In fact, <i>Business Insider</i> discovered that LinkedIn is the only major social media outlet that has higher penetration rates among users in the 50- to 64-year-old age group than in the 18- to 29-year-old bracket.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>A 2013 <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/where-do-marketers-get-customers?utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=8805004&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9wDIK58sRTNFGSxzX1WMaG_o55KO1EVVBDZCHdGAcCF_hrfr57C3NEqDXkpBXKCUlQtsfYLgkhhqJKVUtrHLnZ4KGG9w&amp;_hsmi=8805004&amp;__hstc=200027697.7479b490784a4be8c8637e897574de60.1429799283910.1429799283910.1429799283910.1&amp;__hssc=200027697.2.1429799283910&amp;__hsfp=1511966030" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">study</a> found that 53 percent of business-to-business <a href="http://www.factbrowser.com/tags/linkedin/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">advertisers</a> had successfully used LinkedIn to acquire a customer, compared to 22 percent for business to consumer marketers, Perrine said.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Advertisers can target LinkedIn audiences on everything from their job titles and employers to geography and age, Perrine said. That can be a compelling proposition for purveyors of high-end business services, such as accounting and valuation.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>But observers such as WordStream have noted that LinkedIn can be a costly advertising platform.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>LinkedIn may simply provide a wealthier, higher-end audience than many small businesses need or can afford, Perrine said. For advertisers that cater to younger or less affluent demographics, other social platforms may better serve their interests.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><b>Pinterest and Instagram: Picture-heavy</b></p>  <p>Pinterest has definite pluses for marketers, although some outsiders are already wondering how much growth will be in store for the site, which should hit <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/02/25/pinterest-usage/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">47 million</a> monthly active users this year.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>An eMarketer study <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Will-Pinterest-Reach-Its-Potential-2015/1012103?ecid=PR1003" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">released</a> in February said that Pinterests essential function  serving as an online pin board or visual bookmark  isnt necessarily something that large numbers of people may want to do.</p>  <p>Another point to consider: The vast majority of Pinterest members are female. Although men are growing their share of Pinterests user base, they currently make up 16.7 percent, and eMarketer projects they will account for only 20.5 percent by 2019.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>While <a href="http://www.thefemalefactor.com/statistics/statistics_about_women.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">estimates</a> vary, women drive somewhere between 70 percent to 80 percent of consumer spending. They also serve as 75 percent of the primary shoppers in their households, Perrine noted. Marketers who ignore female customers do so at their peril.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>That said, Pinterest is still an emerging platform, and thus may not be a perfect fit for every advertiser.</p>  <p>The emphasis on Pinterest is the visual, Perrine said. To attract users attention, marketers need compelling images or videos, which can be a challenge for small businesses in, say, the services space.</p>  <p>Another issue is Pinterests advertising product suite, which eMarketer called fairly limited.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>While Pinterest may have value for some small businesses, it remains something of a niche play, Perrine said.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Some of the knocks on Pinterest as marketing vehicle also extend to Instagram, the image and video-heavy social site that Facebook owns.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>In addition, figures floated in the trade press about the cost of Instagram advertising suggest that the network could be beyond the means of many small businesses.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>A year ago, one outlet <a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/monthly-cost-instagram-ad-campaign-approach-1m/292441/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reported</a> that Instagram ad campaigns can cost nearly $1 million, Perrine said. Fairly or not, when those types of numbers surface, entrepreneurs can be left with the impression that Instagram is a playground for big brands alone.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><b>Why Twitter works</b></p>  <p>Twitter brings an advantage for advertisers that other social platforms cannot match: The ability to reach consumers at the time theyre ready to buy.</p>  <p>The seemingly simple innovation of limiting users posts to 140 characters means people use Twitter to express what they want in real time, Perrine said. Two of the most common phrases that people Tweet are I want and I need. Those are the words every advertiser wants to hear.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>While the sheer volume of Twitter usage can present a challenge for small marketers, tools like SocialCentiv can make the process of finding willing customers a snap.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Some <a href="https://about.twitter.com/company" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">288 million</a> monthly active users send roughly 500 million Tweets daily, Perrine said. That can be a lot of posts to comb through. But SocialCentivs tools help companies filter out the noise so they can respond in real time with discounts on products and services on which people want to spend money.</p>  <p>The bottom line, he added, is that SocialCentivs software provide small businesses with an affordable, easy and fast avenue for finding new customers in a way that simply wasnt possible before Twitter got its start in 2006.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>While every social platform presents marketing advantages, nothing beats Twitter, he said.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><b>About SocialCentiv</b></p>  <p>In August 2014, HipLogiq integrated its portfolio of Twitter marketing applications under a single product line, SocialCentiv.

<p>OAK BROOK,&nbsp;Ill., May 4,&nbsp;2015 /PRNewswire/ --&nbsp;McDonald's President and Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook today announced the initial steps of the Company's turnaround plan including a restructuring of McDonald's worldwide business and financial updates. </p><p></p><p> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			   																																									  "Today we are announcing the initial steps to reset and turn around our business," Easterbrook said. "As we look to shape McDonald's future as a modern, progressive burger company, our priorities are threefold - driving operational growth, returning excitement to our brand and unlocking financial value."</p><p></p><p> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			   																																									  Easterbrook added, "The immediate priority for our business is restoring growth under a new organizational structure and ownership mix designed to provide greater focus on the customer, improve our operating fundamentals and drive a recommitment to running great restaurants. As we turn around our business, we will look to create more excitement around the brand and ensure that we build on our rich heritage of positively impacting the communities we serve."</p><p></p><p> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			   																																									  New Market Segments Established</p><p></p><p> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			   																																									  Easterbrook continued, "The first critical step of our operational growth-led plan is to strengthen our effectiveness and efficiency to drive faster and more customer-led decisions. We will restructure our business into four new segments that combine markets with similar needs, challenges, and opportunities for growth." </p><p></p><p> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			   																																									  Beginning July 1, 2015, McDonald's will operate under a new organizational structure with the following market segments:</p><p></p><p> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			   																																																		U.S. - the Company's largest segment, accounting for more than 40% of the Company's 2014 operating income; </p><p>International Lead Markets - established markets including Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the U.K., which operate within similar economic and competitive dynamics, offer similar growth opportunities and collectively represented about 40% of the Company's 2014 operating income; </p><p>High-Growth Markets - markets with relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential including China, Italy, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Together these markets accounted for about 10% of the Company's 2014 operating income; and </p><p>Foundational Markets - the remaining markets in the McDonald's system, each of which has the potential to operate under a largely franchised model. Corporate activities will also be reported within this segment.Easterbrook added, "Our new structure will be supported by streamlined teams with fewer layers and less bureaucracy, and our markets will be better organized around their growth drivers, resource needs and contributions to the Company's overall profitability. McDonald's new structure will more closely align similar markets so they can better leverage their collective insights, energy and expertise to deliver a stronger menu, service, and overall experience for our customers."</p><p></p><p> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			   																																									  Segment Leadership Team Appointed</p><p></p><p> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			   																																									  "Our new organization creates a structure under which leadership of McDonald's new segments will be able to more effectively address the common needs of their markets and customers," Easterbrook said. "It is critical that we position our management talent within our new structure in a way that capitalizes on their skill sets. As such, I am pleased to announce the leadership team for our new segments, effective July 1, 2015." </p><p></p><p> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			   																																									  "Mike Andres will continue to serve as President - McDonald's U.S. Mike is a progressive, strategic thinker with the vision necessary to capitalize on the opportunities in the U.S. market."</p><p></p><p> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			   																																									  "Doug Goare, currently President - McDonald's Europe, will become President - International Lead Markets. Doug is an exceptional leader with strong management and operations experience and a deep working knowledge of McDonald's business. Doug is ideally suited to oversee the talented teams in place across this established group of markets as they work to improve their performance."</p><p></p><p> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			   																																									  "Dave Hoffmann, currently President - McDonald's Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA), will transition to the role of President - High-Growth Markets. Dave is a results-oriented leader with outstanding experience building the brand in emerging markets like China. He is uniquely qualified to lead this new segment in pursuing the tremendous opportunities that exist for McDonald's across this group of markets."</p><p></p><p> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			   																																									  "Ian Borden, currently the Chief Financial Officer - McDonald's APMEA, will assume the role of President - Foundational Markets. In this role, Ian will be responsible for maximizing the potential of these approximately 100 markets that represent about 10% of the Company's operating income. Ian brings very broad geographical and functional expertise to this role having worked in Canada, Europe and APMEA in various finance and operations leadership positions."</p><p></p><p> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			   																																									  New Refranchising Target and Financial&nbsp;Updates Announced</p><p></p><p> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			   																																									  "As we restructure our organization and instill greater customer focus, McDonald's turnaround will be governed by stronger financial discipline, faster decision making and clear management accountability," said McDonald's Chief Administrative Officer Pete Bensen. "This new organization structure will unleash more entrepreneurial spirit and more innovation across our system while bolstering what makes McDonald's a formidable leader in the industry: our incredible network of dedicated franchisees." </p><p></p><p> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			   																																									  The enhancements to McDonald's operating approach will be accompanied by plans to further optimize the Company's restaurant ownership mix, deliver GA savings and accelerate cash returned to shareholders. Specifically, the Company expects to:</p><p></p><p> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			   																																																		Refranchise 3,500 restaurants by the end of 2018, accelerating the pace of refranchising and increasing the global franchised percentage from the current 81% to about 90%. This marks a significant step forward from our prior plan to refranchise at least 1,500 restaurants by 2016; </p><p>Deliver approximately $300 million in net annual GA savings, most of which will be realized by the end of 2017, in connection with the Company's organizational restructure, refranchising strategy, and more stringent discipline around spending throughout the organization; and </p><p>Return $8 to $9 billion to shareholders in 2015 and to reach the top end of its 3-year $18 to $20 billion cash return to shareholders target by the end of 2016.Bensen continued, "As part of our business restructuring, we are focused on further optimizing our restaurant ownership mix and expect franchised restaurants to account for approximately 90% of our global restaurant base by the end of 2018. In conjunction with our refranchising plans, we will take a market-by-market approach, set higher financial screens for markets operating company-operated restaurants, and leverage both conventional and developmental licensee structures across the segments. Our new, more heavily-franchised business model will generate more stable and predictable revenue and cash flow streams and will require a less resource-intensive support structure. Finally, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to further enhance value for all shareholders."</p><p></p><p> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			   																																									  Easterbrook concluded, "These are exciting and liberating moves for our System, and this is how leadership brands evolve to stay in step with their customers. Meaningful, positive measures of improvement will take time. The most impactful measures of our performance will be through the eyes of our customers. While we continue our efforts to regain business momentum through our turnaround plan and improve sales at our more than 36,000 restaurants around the world, our current performance reflects the ongoing pressures of the business, which we expect to persist through at least the first half of the year. We are taking decisive and necessary action to drive foundational improvements in the business and position the Company for long-term growth."</p><p></p><p> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			   																																									  RELATED COMMUNICATIONS</p><p></p><p> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			   																																									  This press release should be read in conjunction with Exhibit 99.2 in the Company's Form 8-K filing for supplemental information.</p><p></p><p> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			   																																									  McDonald's Corporation will broadcast an investor conference call to discuss its initial turnaround plan live over the Internet at 10:00 a.m. Central Time on Monday, May 4, 2015.

&nbsp;See You Again, Kathmandu aims at digital restoration of sites damaged in the earthquake.<br><p>Beijing, May 5, 2015  On April 25, a magnitude 8.1 earthquake struck Nepal, killing several thousand with the death toll continuing to rise, and severely damaging many ancient building on the list UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Sites. Damage to the sites may take a decade. But they can be fully and rapidly restored, at least in cybserspace, using big data and deep learning technologiesprovided that enough photos are available. </p>  <p>&nbsp;With this in mind, on April 29th, Chinese search engine Baidu launched an initiative it calls See You Again, Kathmandu in an effort to digitally restore as many of these sites as possible by using Baidu Panorama, the immersive 3D imaging system we use for our immersive city maps. Specifically, were using Baidus Panoramic Photo Tour system: Panoramic Photo Tour has not actually launched yet, but we thought it was important to use all the means available to us to begin the digital restoration of these damaged sites in Nepal as soon as possible. We hope that Internet users from around the world who have not been able to visit Nepal can virtually visit these World Cultural Heritage sites, and see what they looked like before the devastation of the April 25 quake.</p>  <p>&nbsp;Since its launch, the initiative has received very strong support from Internet users. As of 2pm on May 4, Baidu had received 31,109 photos from Internet users. Three sites in Nepal have already been basically restored.</p>  <p>&nbsp;Baidu has provided a basic English interface for its photo upload site. If you have traveled to Nepal and have photos of any of the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage sites (including Bhimsen Tower, Swayambhunath, Bodhnath, and Durbar Square in Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhaktapur, please upload your pictures here: <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://pai.baidu.com/sheyingshi/earthquake/index#rd">http://pai.baidu.com/sheyingshi/earthquake/index#rd</a></p>  <p>&nbsp;Panoramic Photo Tour is a novel, efficient approach to organizing and presenting massive numbers of crowdsourced images. It incorporates three technology components: 3D Reconstruction, Intelligent Travel Path Planning, and Non-Photorealistic Rendering (NPR). 3D information of a real-world scenario is restored through a large number of user-generated pictures. Photographic hot-spot distributions are determined through analysis of the uploaded photos, and the best presentation path for a scenario is then calculated. Continuous and dynamic 3D videos are then automatically generated from discrete, static photographs. At present, Google and Baidu are the only two companies that have used UGC photos to create photo-based panoramic tours, and Baidu is alone in having enabled this experience on the product end.</p>  <p>&nbsp;Once the restoration is completed, users can view a 3D video of the restored site from a tourists perspective. In addition to a full view of the spatially restored site, the 3D video can display what the site would look like during different times of daydaytime, dusk, nightand under different weather conditions, like rain, snow, overcast skies and bright sunshine. Site restoration thus adds another spatiotemporal dimension.</p>  <p>&nbsp;Heres how it works. First, we crowdsource large numbers of photos. Thankfully, with the growing popularity of image-based social networking, the widespread availability of high-resolution smartphone cameras, and the relative affordability of good DSLRs, huge numbers of high-quality UGC photos are now available online. The See You Again, Kathmandu initiative was designed to help restore damaged sites based on these photos, all taken with different equipment from disparate angles and under different weather conditions. The more photos we have, the higher the quality of the restoration.</p>  <p>&nbsp;Next, a complete, detail-rich 3D model of the site is created using Baidus 3D Reconstruction and a very large number of photos taken from different viewing angles. These photos vary widely in terms of quality. Problems include rotation, blurring, zoom distortion, and size differences. Invalid and low-quality photos need to be removed, and this involves powerful big data processing. </p>  <p>We identify the most popular spots for photography of a given site, and then use a path search algorithm to select a set of photos from among all the UGC images. This set of photos enables a spatially orderly view of these hotspots, while also highlighting changes in the same scenario over time, bringing more interesting viewer experiences.</p>  <p>The next step is rendering. Image-based Non-Photo Realistic technology uses the 3D model and the planned travel path to generate video based on the static images. </p>  <p>Between 500 and 1,000 photos taken from different viewing angles are needed on average for restoration and reconstruction. This explains why different sites are being digitally restored at different rates. The faster restoration of Maju Deval and Fasidega Temple, completed on May 3, was due to the great number of photos of those sites uploaded by Internet users, and also to the variety of viewing angles in the photos we received. </p>  <p>Today, users can view the panoramic videos of these sites by clicking check on the Maju Deval or Narayan (Vishnu) Temple, both under Patan Durbar Square; or Fasidega Temple (under Badaghaon Durbar Square) at the link above.

        <p>The Big Apple Indie Music Series aka TBAIMS has expanded it's scope in terms of support for the independent music artists. With the addition of their new 3 Tier membership program, they can now offer the independent music artist services that were not readily available at affordable rates. TBAIMS is now offering production, publishing and their own label. In addition, they have new partners that will help the artists even further with their music careers such as vocal coaching, and learning how to write a hit song working with successful professionals in the industry.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Next Wednesday will be one of the biggest events to date with Lauren D, their main Master of Ceremonies performing with her band and what makes this really special is the fact that she has hired a bus to bring in over 78 of her own fans from New Jersey for the duration of the showcase. The bus will be parked right out front for the evening that should cause some curiosity by anyone walking by the venue.  In addition, they have Lauren Marsh, Victory Jones, Manny James and Echo Bloom.</p> <p><br></p> <p>In addition, TBAIMS is collaborating with TheCoolTV Music Video Network to offer their artists a huge discount on the video services TheCoolTV Music Video Network has to offer. This will make having their music videos go into rotation along with major headliner music artists for a fraction of what it would normally cost them.</p> <p><br></p> <p>TBAIMS continues to connect with companies and services to help with the careers of the independent music artists that are part if their growing family. It has become one of the best music showcases in Manhattan based on the level of talent they screen before inviting them to perform. </p> <p><br></p> <p>The interest in sponsorship has begun to grow.

Image-based Non-Photo Realistic technology uses the 3D model and the planned travel path to generate video based on the static images. </p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Between 500 and 1,000 photos taken from different viewing angles are needed on average for restoration and reconstruction. This explains why different sites are being digitally restored at different rates. The faster restoration of Maju Deval and Fasidega Temple, completed on May 3, was due to the great number of photos of those sites uploaded by Internet users, and also to the variety of viewing angles in the photos we received. </p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Today, users can view the panoramic videos of these sites by clicking check on the Maju Deval or Narayan (Vishnu) Temple, both under Patan Durbar Square; or Fasidega Temple (under Badaghaon Durbar Square) at the link above.

<p>Spotify, which is widely believed to be behind the antitrust&nbsp;allegations that led&nbsp;to both EC and DOJ investigations into Apple, has now added a fresh complaint. The Verge&nbsp;reports Spotify is complaining that&nbsp;the 30% cut Apple takes from in-app Premium subscriptions in the iOS app amounts to an Apple tax.</p><p></p><p>Apple charges a 30 percent fee toward any sales through its App Store, and that includes subscription services. That means if Spotify wants to sell its premium subscription service  which usually costs $9.99 a month &nbsp;through the App Store, it has to raise the price 30 percent higher to $12.99 to pull in the same revenue, while Apple can still offer Beats at a lower price. Spotify and many others in the music industry believe Apples App Store tax gives them an unfair advantage over the competition.</p><p></p><p>One unnamed music industry source said that Apple taking 30% was **cking bullsh** </p><p></p><p>Spotify Premium normally costs $9.99/month, and if you sign up via the web at that price, you can use your Premium subscription in the iOS app. But if you download the app, use the free tier and then buy a Premium subscription via an in-app purchase, it costs $12.99  and App Store guidelines mean the app cant point you to the web instead.</p><p></p><p>The allegations&nbsp;leading to the EC and DOJ investigations are that Apple has been engaging in anti-competitive behavior by pressuring music labels into&nbsp;dropping support for free, ad-supported streaming services like Spotify and YouTube. If true, this would suggest Apple is trying to reduce competition in the market from free services in order to make its rebranded Beats Music service more appealing.</p><p></p><p>Apple had reportedly hoped to offer its own service for&nbsp;$5/month, but was unable to secure the necessary deals from music labels. A revised attempt&nbsp;at hitting &nbsp;$7.99/month&nbsp;also&nbsp;reportedly failed&nbsp;for the same reason, even though Google Play offered initial All Access Signups for a $7.99 locked in.</p><p></p><p>Apple is expected to formally announce&nbsp;its streaming music at WWDC as part of an iOS 8.4 update that will see it integrated into the existing Music app, with access on Macs via an iTunes update. There is some doubt as to whether the&nbsp;service will actually launch&nbsp;at the point at which it is announced.</p>
<p>Microsoft quietly launched a set of new machine-learning APIs in beta under the Project Oxford moniker yesterday and today its How-Old.net demo for this service went viral.</p><p></p><p>This site lets you upload photos of faces and then it automatically figures out how old the person in that photo is.&nbsp;Its a cool&nbsp;demo  and works&nbsp;reasonably well (though as expected it makes its fair number of mistakes).&nbsp;Its best to take its results with a grain of salt, but while Microsofts demo is interesting, the use case for this is probably more along the lines of trying&nbsp;to figure out whether an images features a child or adult, for example.</p><p></p><p>How-Old uses some  but not all  of the new developer services that are part of Project Oxford.</p><p></p><p>The new APIs also allow developers to add face detection and recognition features to their apps. By default, the service will try to figure out what the users age is and give that information to developers.</p><p></p><p>As&nbsp;Ryan Galgon, a senior program manager&nbsp;on&nbsp;the Oxford project at&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;Technology and Research told me at Microsofts Build developer conference today, Oxford and the age-detection project was the result of a major collaboration between different groups inside of Microsoft. Much of whats available through the service today is based on modern deep learning techniques the company worked on over the last few years.</p><p></p><p>Right out of the box, this API also offers face detection in images, face verification to check whether&nbsp;two faces belong to the same person, and the ability to find similar-looking faces.</p><p></p><p>Other tools include&nbsp;speech recognition&nbsp;and over time, the service will be able to help developers understand their users intent. The project also features a vision API for automatically categorizing images and&nbsp;creating smart image crops&nbsp;that always put the subject into the center of the cropped images.</p><p></p><p>These three services are now available as a public beta. Theres also a fourth API that lets developers build custom language understanding into their applications.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Microsoft offered a set of somewhat similar APIs under the Bing brand. Bing offers a speech and translator API, for example, but for the most part, these Bing services are somewhat more basic&nbsp;and search-focused than the Project Oxford tools. These Bing APIs, Galgon told me, were more focused on the Windows desktop experience, though. The Project Oxford tools, on the other hand, are available as RESTful APIs (with a limit of 5,000 calls per month).</p><p></p><p>The Speech API, as the name implies, offers speech-recognition services for speech-to-text conversion, as well as a text-to-speech service that turns written text into audio. More interestingly, though, it also features intent recognition. The idea here is to allow application to understand the speakers intent (order a burrito, cancel a flight, etc.). This is driven by the projects Language Understanding&nbsp;Intelligent Service.</p><p></p><p>Using the image API, developers can categorize images to filter out adult content, for example, or to simply automatically apply tags to images or group them into clusters. The API also features optical character recognition capabilities and lets developers crop images automatically by recognizing whats important in an image and keeping that in the center of the photo as you crop it.</p><p></p><p>For now, the service is available for free. Its unclear when Microsoft plans to charge for access, but Galgon told me that the company is committed to evolving these services over time.</p><p></p><p>Even if youre not a developer, you can give some of these features a try here.</p>

When it comes to reporting and analytics, getting correct and meaningful data is actually very complicated.</div><div><br></div><div>One simple example: a user sees 11 total ads and buys something on your website. &nbsp;So the frequency that helped convert that user was 11, right? Probably not. What if you had two targets, 18-34 year old males, and adults 25-54? Each target audience is shown a different message. This user fell into both, seeing the first message four times and the second message five times. Thats only nine ads. However, thats when the user bought the product. Then the user saw two more ads after buying as part of an upselling re-targeting campaign. So, is the number nine? 11? Or is it four or five? Which ad did the user see first? Last before buying? Does it matter? Now you see why so many buyers say, Ill put that money into TV. At least I know I cant know.</div><div><br></div><div>The transparency, reporting and analytics of digital advertisings effectiveness is also the subject of specific and current debate regarding ROI--fraud. </div><div><br></div><div>In the simplest terms with digital ads, there are two kinds of fraud  the stuff thats easy to detect and the stuff thats next-to-impossible to detect. The first kind is easy. Youre serving 20-30 impressions/day on site xyz.com and getting one click per month. All of a sudden youre serving 5,000 impressions/day on xyz.com and getting 2,000 clicks. Easy to detect and scrub. The second kind could be called the Office Space fraud problem. Youll remember in that movie, their idea was to take the fractions of a penny that remain from bank transactions and feed them into an account. Online fraudsters here are less greedy and run a variety of scams little bits at a time. </div><div><br></div><div>If you read the headlines, its there are billions of dollars being lost to digital ad fraud and everyone should panic. However, when you dig into it deeper, the fraud is pretty highly concentrated. This article, for instance, starts out pretty scary. Then you realize three sources are responsible for 77 percent of this problem. The same is true in display and video ads. Most exchanges and SSPs are really clean. There are a few where its concentrated, and while those names arent published anywhere, theyre well known in off-the-record conversations at industry conferences. Most of us just dont run any ads in that available inventory space.</div><div><br></div><div>Media buyers for digital advertising do know where their ads will run  if theyre working with the right programmatic partner. Our companys blacklist of sites is double the size of most in the industry. We can run on a whitelist model instead. We can run private marketplace deals where buyers are guaranteed a specific amount of inventory from a certain website. Five years ago this was not as easy. Today, any good programmatic partner will share with you every piece of data they have to make it a collaborate effort.</div><div><br></div><div>When it comes to the type of ad measurement tools providing factual, honest and correct levels of ROI, Id ask the same question for every other medium before answering it for digital. Who does this for TV, radio, newspaper, or outdoor? There is no black/white line of its not measurable/its perfectly measureable. Theres a lot of gray, and that gray is very good for marketers. Even within what marketers think should be in the black, such as my consumer saw an ad and then bought a product online, attribution among digital media and offline media sources is not perfect.</div><div><br></div><div>Heres my advice for determining ROI or assigning credit to your digital media channels:</div><div><br></div><div>1)	Expect digital to be more measurable than offline media, but not possess magical powers.</div><div>2)	Dont eschew a model because its not perfect. Did you ever tell your teacher youd rather have a 0 on a test instead of a 75 because neither was 100? Accept progress in the absence of perfection. </div><div>3)	Use some form of attribution that is anything other than last view or last click. While those are better than nothing, youre still getting a 25 on your test and I cant say I feel all that much better with a 25 than a 0.</div><div>4)	Instead of insisting on getting a dollar amount of ratio out of your ROI equation, insist on getting a weather vane that tells you where the wind is blowing. Youre going to spend money marketing your products because we all know it works. So, get tools that tell you this and not that, or this worked slightly better than that. Directional intelligence is still intelligence.</div><div><br></div><div>In summation, ROI is real, and every study weve ever run for a client shows lift in consumer behavior and purchases on exposed users compared to a control. Where I see most advertisers getting into trouble is when they insist on measurement being perfect, or holding different media channels to different standards. All advertising and each media channel contributes to product sales. Its likely impossible to control for all but one variable at any given time and so marketers get frustrated with their inability to know for sure and instead go with what they personally believe works the best. That focus group of one person (meaning the marketer) wastes more money than every other digital media problem combined.</div><div><br></div>

  <h4><b>Giant-Voice Installation at Hawthorne Army Depot Enables SOC Nevada to Meet Mandate<br></b></h4><p><b>Marietta, GA &nbsp; May 20, 2015  </b>SOC Nevada LLC estimates it avoided millions in infrastructure costs by installing a solar-powered, wireless mass notification system consisting of six <a title="Link: http://http://www.imlcorp.com/sc360.html" href="http://http://www.imlcorp.com/sc360.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SoundCommander® SC360</a> speaker systems to cover approximately 212 square miles at the Hawthorne Army Depot, Hawthorne, NV. <br></p>  <p>The US Army mandated the new mass notification system (MNS) to upgrade security at the facility. It serves as a weapons storage and transportation site for branches of the US Armed Services on the West Coast. SOC, the contractor to manage operations and maintain the facility, chose the giant-voice SC360 systems from IMLCORP, Marietta, GA in three configurations because of their power and voice clarity and their manufacturers ability to deliver the solar system to back-up the batteries and the wireless system to communicate with each speaker from a central operations center. And the system fit the budget, too, with the system costing less than 10 percent of a wired installation. <br></p>  <p>Before we installed the new SoundCommander system, we had a single speaker on an industrial building on the base, said David Ellis, Planner/Estimator, SOC Nevada. That just didnt have the capability to provide warnings and instructions for the base in the event of an active shooter, a terrorist attack or any conditions where we need to warn personnel. <br></p>  <p>In addition to warning personnel on the base, the new MNS will be audible to people not connected with any other type of communication system. The base surrounds the city of Hawthorne, with its population of 3,300, and easements allow highways to pass through the area. <br></p>  <p>Installing wired power and communications infrastructure would have faced challenges beyond the estimated expense of as much as $5 million, Ellis noted. The high winds that buffet the area precluded any above-ground lines, and soil conditions for trenching and then housing the lines, plus the marking requirements, made solar and wireless the only viable option. The farthest speaker in the network is located eight miles from the bases operation center. <br></p>  <p>For IMLCORP, the system design and solar/wireless adaptation were straightforward, customized engineering solutions. <br></p>  <p>We used sound measurement equipment to determine how much speaker power was required to provide the required volume levels in all coverage areas, said Frank M. Myers, President and CEO, IMLCORP. That enabled us to configure each of the speaker arrays using our SC360 High Performance Speaker Array (HPSA) systems, all of which have 3600 coverage for optimum performance. For three locations, we installed SC360 Quad Hex systems (four stacked six-speaker arrays). For two locations, we installed SC360 Dual Hex units (two tiers  12 speakers), and one location needed a single SC360 (one tier  six speakers). <br></p>  <p>All of our systems come standard with battery backup, so we already have battery power for our SC360s, he continued. It was just a matter of integrating the solar panels and power controllers with the HPSAs and using wireless IP (internet protocol) to set up the communication system. That enables operators to activate any array at any time and receive full parametric status monitoring at the control center  100 percent of the time, 24/7. They know the status of each array at any time, including battery level, amplifier status, system temperature and whether the system amplifiers cabinet door is open or closed. &nbsp;This level of parametric monitoring not only insures real-time awareness of the systems readiness, but saves maintenance and repair costs by allowing system techs be more efficient and take preventative measures as needed to ensure the system is ready at all times.  We can design and install a mass notification system like this anywhere in the world. <br></p>  <p>The system gets a daily test with the playing of colors at the start of the day and lowering the flag at the end of each day. The music is prerecorded, and the scheduling is automated. <br></p>  <p>I like the way it works, Ellis said. It has simplicity of use and maintenance. We just need to check for the same things at every location. <br></p>  <p><b>About IMLCORP</b><br>Established in 1991 and based in Marietta (Atlanta), GA, IMLCORP develops, manufactures and distributes SoundCommander® loudspeaker systems for tactical operations and emergency mass notification systems, which are part of systems on college and university campuses, military bases and other public venues.

A test case, in software engineering, is a set of conditions under which a tester will determine whether an application, software system or one of its features is working as it was originally established for it to do. The mechanism for determining whether a software program or system has passed or failed such a test is known as a test oracle. In some settings, an oracle could be a requirement or use case, while in others it could be a heuristic. It may take many test cases to determine that a software program or system is considered sufficiently scrutinized to be released. Test cases are often referred to as test scripts, particularly when written - when they are usually collected into test suites.<br><br>In order to fully test that all the requirements of an application are met, there must be at least two test cases for each requirement: one positive test and one negative test. If a requirement has sub-requirements, each sub-requirement must have at least two test cases. Keeping track of the link between the requirement and the test is frequently done using a traceability matrix. Written test cases should include a description of the functionality to be tested, and the preparation required to ensure that the test can be conducted.<br><br>A formal written test-case is characterized by a known input and by an expected output, which is worked out before the test is executed. The known input should test a precondition and the expected output should test a postcondition.<br><br>For applications or systems without formal requirements, test cases can be written based on the accepted normal operation of programs of a similar class. In some schools of testing, test cases are not written at all but the activities and results are reported after the tests have been run.<br><br>In scenario testing, hypothetical stories are used to help the tester think through a complex problem or system. These scenarios are usually not written down in any detail. They can be as simple as a diagram for a testing environment or they could be a description written in prose. The ideal scenario test is a story that is motivating, credible, complex, and easy to evaluate. They are usually different from test cases in that test cases are single steps while scenarios cover a number of steps of the key.<br><br>A test case is usually a single step, or occasionally a sequence of steps, to test the correct behaviour/functionality, features of an application.

                 <p><u>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</u></p>  <p>Contact: Kerri Steinberg, kstein919@gmail.com<br></p>  <p><b><br></b></p><p><b>University Press Bookstore </b>in <b>Berkeley, CA</b> presents:</p>  <p><i>JEWISH MAD MEN: ADVERTISING AND THE DESIGN OF THE AMERICAN JEWISH EXPERIENCE</i></p>  <p>In-store reading with Author and Art Historian Kerri Steinberg</p>  <p><b>May 27, 2015 @ 6:00 pm  7:30 pm</b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p>May 26th, BERKELEY, CA, Author and Art Historian Kerri Steinberg will be reading from her new book <i><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://universitypressbooks.com/event/jewish-mad-men/?instance_id=956">Jewish Mad Men: Advertising and the Design of the American Jewish Experience </a></i>on May 27th, 2015, 6pm at&nbsp;University Press Bookstore (2430 Bancroft Way Berkeley, CA 94704).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>It is easy to dismiss advertising as simply the background chatter of modern life, often annoying, sometimes hilarious, and ultimately meaningless. But Kerri P. Steinberg argues that a careful study of the history of advertising can reveal a wealth of insight into a culture. In <i>Jewish Mad Men</i>, Steinberg looks specifically at how advertising helped shape the evolution of American Jewish life and culture over the past one hundred years.<br></p><p><br></p>  <p>Drawing on case studies of famous advertising campaignsfrom Levys Rye Bread (You dont have to be Jewish to love Levys) to Hebrew National hot dogs (We answer to a higher authority)Steinberg examines advertisements from the late nineteenth-century in New York, the center of advertising in the United States, to trace changes in Jewish life there and across the entire country. She looks at ads aimed at the immigrant population, at suburbanites in midcentury, and at hipster and post-denominational Jews today.</p><p><br></p>  <p>In addition to discussing campaigns for everything from Manischewitz wine to matzoh, <i>Jewish Mad Men</i>&nbsp;also portrays the legendary Jewish figures in advertisinglike Albert Lasker and Bill Bernbachand lesser known Mad Men like Joseph Jacobs, whose pioneering agency created the brilliantly successful Maxwell House Coffee Haggadah. Throughout, Steinberg uses the lens of advertising to illuminate the Jewish trajectory from outsider to insider, and the related arc of immigration, acculturation, upward mobility, and suburbanization.</p><p><br></p>  <p>Of <i>Mad Men</i>, acclaimed design critic Steven Heller says, Steinberg explains how Jewish Mad Men wrestled their way into mainstream firms,  and became influential in imagining and promoting the American Dream and the Jewish American version  and how certain brands were advertised to Jews as the staples of an American lifestyle, which helped consumers assimilate into commercial culture.Although there was plenty of anti-Semitism in the so-called white shoe ad world, this book is about the complexity of being Jewish and American in a field whose ultimate goal is to influence Americans daily behavior. Steinberg examines how, in the early 20th century, advertising was used by secular Jews to brand their own people, culture and religion for American public consumption by, among other things, [s]ituating Jewish difference within the spectrum of American pluralism.</p><p><br></p>  <p>Anchored in the illustrations, photographs, jingles, and taglines of advertising, <i>Jewish Mad Men</i>&nbsp;features a dozen color advertisements and many black-and-white images. Lively and insightful, this book offers a unique look at both advertising and Jewish life in the United States.</p>  <p><br></p><p><b>About The Author</b></p>  <p>Kerri Steinberg holds a Ph.D. in Art History from the University of California, Los Angeles, and is a professor at Otis College of Art and Design in Los Angeles. From fashion design through advertising, her work assigns prominence to the role of the visual in reinforcing and producing American Jewish identities, moving issues of visual representation from the sidelines to the center. Her publication record includes articles and reviews on visual culture and American Jewish self-representation. Her book, <i>Jewish Mad Men: Advertising and the Design of the American Jewish Experience </i>(2015)<i> </i>was published by Rutgers University Press.</p><p><br></p><p>SOURCE: Rutgers University Press</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>###</p>

                  <p>Women who love to shop know all about the difficulties of keeping their frequent buyer and loyalty cards organized. It seems almost impossible to be able to locate the right one when you need it, let alone find anything in those oversized, bottomless handbags.

It is stressful when you go to the register and cant find the loyalty card or punch card you know you have.

<p>When Vivat (from brands such as SNS Reaal and Zwitserleven) announced it has agreed with a takeover by Anbang, most people never heard of this illustrious and cash-rich Chinese company, let alone the founder Xiaohui Wu, who founded the company only 11 years ago. Telecom giant Huawei, car maker BYD, insurance software developer eBaotech, and diary producer Yili are among the many that have set foot in the Dutch market. Many of the overseas Chinese companies are not state-owned but privately owned, founded and run by star entrepreneurs, who gain celebrity status in China. Who are these entrepreneurs? Where do they come from? What is driving these private companies? </p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Not long ago, private entrepreneurs were seen as the signs of unwanted capitalism. In the early phase of opening up, 1978-1992, private companies were merely seen as supplements and had a dubious semi-illegal status; it is the period where Guangqiu Lu's Wanxiang Group, Qinghou Zong 's Wahaha and Chuanzhi Liu's Lenovo were founded or transformed from government organizations to semi-privately run companies. Xiaoping Deng's famous speech in Shenzhen in 1992 endorsed private firms legal status and in the period 1992-2000, a lot of elite entrepreneurs, who previously worked for the government, saw the opportunities that private companies provided; companies such as Lun Feng' s Vantone Group and Dongshen Chen's Taikang Life. Since 2000 China fully endorsed and promoted private entrepreneurship, giving it equal status to the state sector. A group of entrepreneurs with international vision, strong education and high-tech mindset founded firms such as Jack Ma's Alibaba, Yanhong Li's Baidu and Huateng Ma's Tencent. Private entrepreneurs changed from the ugly duckling to the work horses of China; in only 35 years.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The first generation of entrepreneurs, starting as OEM, can be illustrated by people like Guanqiu Lu, the founder of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wanxiang.com/">Wanxiang Group</a>, a Chinese multinational manufacturer of automotive components. Wanxiang was built from Guangqiu Lu's factory of agricultural machines (1969) and is now domestically stock-listed and acquired the leading transportation battery manufacturer <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.a123systems.com/">A123 Systems</a> from USA in 2013. Similarly entrepreneurial in a time of high political risk is Qinghou Zong, the founder of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wahaha.com.cn/">Wahaha</a>; Chinas largest beverage manufacturer, employing 30,000 people and internationalizing its brands across the world. </p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The so-called "92 pai" (a term invented by Taikang Life founder Dongshen Chen) is considered the second generation of entrepreneurs. With a clear legal status of private companies after Xiaoping Dengs public endorsement in Shenzhen, many former government officials jumped in to the private sector. People such as Lun Feng founded the Vantone Group in 1996, a company operating in real estate and asset management with total assets over 14 billion RMB (2 billion EURO). Lun Feng used to be a teacher at the Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the breeding ground for top cadres and was senior advisor for the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic Systems, the think tank for China's economic reform. An outspoken person, with influential opinions in China, he has become a critic of China's government policy in the property sectors; a proponent of 'retreating the state and advancing the private sector'. </p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The third generation of entrepreneurs is driven by the IT revolution and is exemplified by the "BAT" entrepreneurs: Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. Jack Ma founded <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.alibaba.com/">Alibaba</a>s ecommerce platform in 1999, not only operating the worlds largest online business-to-business platform, but also the worlds largest online consumer marketplace. Recently it broke records with the biggest IPO in US history. Alibaba is, together with <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.baidu.com/">Baidu</a> and Tencent, one of the largest investors in Chinas booming high-tech scene with over 15 acquisitions of domestic high-tech ventures last year, fuelling a new generation of entrepreneurs. This new generation may be not as record breaking large scale but does show the potential for radical technology breakthroughs, business models and innovations. </p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>A possible fourth generation, sometimes referred to "After 1980s", includes entrepreneurs like Weixing Chen, the founder of Kuaidi Taxi app, and Ou Chen, the founder of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://jumei.com/">Jumei.com</a> cosmetics. They utilize an emerging mobile internet society as well as showcasing radical business mindsets. While Weixing Chen started a revolution in the taxi world in 2012, Ou Chen transformed the Chinese cosmetics industry in 2010. Kuaidi Taxi app received large investments from the Alibaba Group, Softbank and Tiger Fund. Ou Chen became a Forbes top entrepreneur in 2012 and his company Jumei.com listed May 2014 on the New York Stock Exchange. In particular the very radical entrepreneurs that are often still in their early 20s get more and more attention; IDG, a global venture capital group, has even a special fund for so-called "After 1990s entrepreneurs". </p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Concluding, it is not the resource rich large state-owned or foreign companies that transform industries, but generations of private entrepreneurs in a wide variety of traditional and newly emerging industries; domestically and abroad. We have seen only the top of the Chinese iceberg and China's international entrepreneurs are here to stay.?</p>
<p>Online Shopping in China</p>  <p>While many foreign companies are entering Chinas large domestic market via alliances, joint-ventures, franchises and other traditional ways of foreign market entry, some companies are cleverly utilizing the Chinese online shopping platforms, such as Alibabas Taobao. Companies such as Procter and Gamble (P&amp;G) in the United States, De Biasi in Italy, Björn Borg in Sweden or Uniqlo in Japan are cost-effectively tapping into one of the largest online shopper communities in the world. </p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Online shopping in China has developed quickly in recent years, yet it is growing at a very fast rate. Nowadays, online shopping has already integrated into peoples daily life in China. China has more than 420 million Internet users and this number is still growing exponentially. More than one third of the Chinese Internet users is shopping online and also this adoption rate is rapidly increasing. For Chinese consumers, the Internet is already an increasingly important, and for some already a routine activity of making a purchase. Chinese Internet users explore the Internet to understand products they are thinking of buying and to hunt for bargains. Taobao is China's largest online shopping platform and was created by its parent group Alibaba in 2003. The online Taobao platform allows sellers and buyers to surf ranging from customer-to-customer (C2C) bazaars to business-to-customer (B2C) branded stores. Taobao reported in June 2012 that it has a staggering number of 500 million registered users and around 800 million product listings.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Market Entry Strategies for China</p>  <p>Meanwhile, the booming of the Chinese online shopping market is very attractive to foreign firms because of its growing consuming power and large consumer base. Due to the geographical diversity, the legal barriers, and lack of customer understanding, this enormous market is less accessible from the outside world. In order to enter this market, and to reduce the investment risks, both foreign-based multi-national corporations and small to medium enterprises have made their presences in the Chinese online shopping market by forming alliances with the Chinese online shopping platform provider. In our research we have seen four different market entry approaches that are very successful. These approaches have a different mixture of onsite and online dimensions; see Figure 1 and Table 1.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Onsite </p>  <p>Advanced&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  </p>  <p>Servicing Strategy&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (2)</p>  <p>Example: De Biasi</p>  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  </p>  <p>Integrating Strategy&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  (3)</p>  <p>Example: Uniqlo</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Onsite</p>  <p>Elementary&nbsp; &nbsp;  </p>  <p>Market Testing Strategy&nbsp; &nbsp;  (1)</p>  <p>Example: Procter &amp; Gamble&nbsp; </p>  <p>Enabling Strategy&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  (4)</p>  <p>Example: Björn Borg</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  </p>  <p>Online </p>  <p>Elementary&nbsp; &nbsp;  </p>  <p>Online </p>  <p>Advanced</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Figure 1: Different Market Entry Strategies for China.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The Market Testing Entry</p>  <p>The first strategy is having distinct but elementary onsite and online dimensions. Take, for example, the entry strategy of Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G)  the American multinational corporation that manufactures a wide range of consumer goods. In 1988, P&amp;G entered into a joint venture with Hutchison Whampoa China Limited (HWCL), one of the largest companies listed on the main board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, to manufacture products in China and launched its Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo in China. The introduction of this product witnessed huge consumer demand. P&amp;G soon expanded its brand portfolio, entering the skin care market with Oil of Olay. China emerged as P&amp;Gs fifth largest market for Head &amp; Shoulders by 1991, although sales were concentrated almost entirely in Guangzhou and the surrounding region. In 2007, P&amp;G opened its first online store on Taobao  the Gillette Braun brand store and in the same year its second brand store  Oral B Professional Oral Care Center, was opened selling electric toothbrushes, dental films, and oral care products. In April2009, P&amp;G also opened its flagship store on Taobao under the name of eLiving at Home. The P&amp;Gs approach can be described as very low key. Not only does the word P&amp;G not appear in the name of the store, at the top of the front page it is titled P&amp;G official distributor P&amp;G brands flagship store. The company behind this store is Yi Shang Yu Jie Beijing Trading Company. Founded in January 3 2008, Yi Shang Yu Jie is one of the core distributors of P&amp;G (Guangzhou) Limited. The company is the main agent of nine P&amp;G product lines: cosmetic make-up brands, hair brands, personal care and cleaning brands, feminine hygiene products, baby products, oral care products, mens care products, detergent, and packaged food. The prices are much lower than those of the supermarkets. Some special promotional efforts resulted in nearly 50% percent discount. The alliance between P&amp;G and Taobao did not only consider the direct benefits on the sales, moreover it was considered that Taobao could provide its innovative marketing model for P&amp;G. P&amp;G has benefited greatly from a series of online sample distribution of fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) launched by Taobao. P&amp;G accessed the database of the online store on Taobao, effectively targeted consumer groups based on region, occupation, and income. And through distributing samples to the identified targeted groups via Taobao, P&amp;G surveyed market conditions of a variety of products. The results can be used as references for the future product research and development. Within the two months of the opening of the Gillette Braun brand store, more than 2,000 electrical shavers were sold on Taobao. P&amp;G tested the water of online shopping market through the alliance with Taobao. Taobao's large consumer database can be used for sampling and testing of the P&amp;G products, the gathered results can be used in the future product development and product market entry strategy.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The Servicing Market Entry </p>  <p>In the second type of entry strategy servicing customers is done with a combination of onsite licensing and online service. An excellent example is De Biasis entry strategy in China. De Biasi was founded in 1974 in Murano, an archipelago nearby Venice, when Virgilio De Biasi started his own business, having learnt everything concerning glass bead workmanship from his father. In the 1980s the company exhibited the collections of artifacts decorated with gold and precious enamels in all the well known salesrooms in Murano. The De Biasi artistic pieces can be seen both at the MACEF Fair in Milan, Paris, Madrid, New   York and many other locations. These works are guaranteed as genuine artifacts, made in Murano, as the company is a member of the Promovetro Association, which has the exclusive right to oversee the awarding of the Murano Artistic Merit Trademark. In October 2007, Cristiano De Biasi signed a contract with Beijing SeDuLiuLi Commercial Center, which gave the exclusive rights to Beijing SeDuLiuLi Commercial Center to sell De Biasi jewelry (pendants, rings, earrings and necklace) and clocks in Greater China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Italian guests paid Taobao a visit in 2010. Prior to the visit, they still had doubts about the market potential, but when they had seen whats happening at Taobao with their own eyes, they were fully convinced about the potential of the online shopping market in China. However, they still had some concerns about the distribution of counterfeit goods and copycats online. Due to language barriers, they needed to entrust their Chinese partner in the operational details of the online store. Beijing SeDuLiuLi Commercial Center opened their first flagship store on Taobao selling Murano handmade jewelries on 12th October, 2010. De Biasi reached Taobao through its Chinese distributor. The Italian SME sees China as its potential market and via its Chinese distributor, De Biasi jewelry were already been sold through the offline channels in some parts of China. The strategic alliance with Taobao allows the company to sell nationwide with low investment.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The Integrating Market Entry</p>  <p>The third strategy that could be distinguished is a full integration of the onsite and online dimensions of the market entry in China. The best example is Uniqlo or 'Unique Clothing' that emerged out of Japan's Fast Retailing Company and is a household name in Japan for reasonably priced casual clothing. In 2002 Uniqlo decided to enter the Chinese market. At the time e-commerce just started to emerge and considering the aftermath of the dotcom bubble, Uniqlo concentrated all its resources on the traditional marketing channels, delivering good quality clothes to all for a low price. However, Chinese competition was fierce and in 2005 they had in total only 9 stores, low brand awareness and poor sales revenues and in 2006 Uniqlo withdrew from the market. At the end of 2006 Uniqlo switched its strategic direction and directly targeted the urban middle class and by April 2008, Uniqlo had 11 shops. Then, in 2009, Uniqlo decided to add online channels to stimulate its growth and formed a strategic alliance with Taobao. A flagship store was opened on Taobao's B2C platform (Taobao Mall) in April while at the same time opening an independent e-commerce website. Although the product representation and style differ between these two sites, the data storage, search, transaction, payment were maintained in the same way, using Taobao's architecture and technical support. In contrast to Chinese domestic brands that used the Taobao Mall to sell discounted products to attract buyers, Uniqlo maintained the same pricing strategy for its offline and online products. On the first day, transactions already reached 3,000 with a total transaction volume of 300,000 RMB and within 11 days, 4.1 million RMB was consumed, a number equal to the summed turnover of all the physical stores. At present the annual online turnover is at least 150 million RMB, without affecting the sales in the physical stores which reached 34 stores after the opening of 26 in 2009. The strategic alliance between Uniqlo and Taobao allows Uniqlo to raise its brand awareness among the online shopping customers in a short period of time. Not only have the online sales of Uniqlo increased after the opening of the online flagship store in Taobao mall, the number of offline Uniqlo stores were increased as well.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The Enabling Market Entry</p>  <p>The fourth strategy that could be distinguished is the Enabling Strategy; distinct but elementary onsite presence and advanced online dimensions. In 2011, Björn Borg decided to enter China and started with setting up a joint venture to handle its distribution in the country. The investing partner, Penny York, has held senior positions since 2004 for the Chinese garment manufacturing and brand company, Dragon Crowd. In August 2012, Björn Borg launched the first shop-in-shop in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Sogo Department store on Shanghais West Nanjing Road, a luxury-shopping street that houses flagship stores of many global brands. It is a safe and easy way to enter China as most brands try to place their flagship stores there, but the whole department store is relatively empty, and their exposure inside this giant mall of brands is not enough to generate big sales. </p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The&nbsp; physical shop is only part of the plan. The company introduces their range throughout the whole of China by opening up an online store on Taobao directly at first entry. Every page on Björn Borgs Taobao store and product pages feature bright branding which signals to consumers that the store is an official, premium flagship store. Björn Borg offered a grand opening launch promotion, with time-limited discounts up to 50% off merchandise exclusive to their Taobao store. In addition, the promotion news was posted on Weibo - a Chinese Twitter - with an external link to the Taobao store. As a matter of fact, Björn Borg began promoting their brand months earlier on Weibo, building their brand story and connecting to the fans that were already talking about their brand. Just like the Weibo account referenced their Taobao store, the Taobao product listings also demonstrate their good reputation on Weibo. Björn Borgs product pages include screenshots from Weibo of people talking about Björn Borg and their affinity for the product line. The combination of Taobao and Weibo is making the brand much more visible and the products more approachable to customers. There will be a number of new stores in Shanghai and the rest of China, aiming for growth through the two channels.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Company Country&nbsp;  First entry&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Online entry&nbsp;  Size Customer</p>  <p>Segmentation&nbsp; Onsite </p>  <p>Dimension&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Online </p>  <p>Dimension</p>  <p>Procter &amp; Gamble&nbsp; USA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1988&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  2007&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  MNC&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lower and middle customer segment&nbsp; &nbsp; Joint-venture (Hutchison Whampoa)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Partnership with core distributor for online shop (Yi Shang Yu Jie); Online activities for market testing and targeting.</p>  <p>De Biasi&nbsp; Italy 2007&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  2010&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  SME&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  High end customer segment&nbsp;  Licensing (Beijing SeDuLiuLi Commercial Center)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Licensing to online shop of licensee (Beijing SeDuLiuLi Commercial Center); Online activities for market entry.</p>  <p>Uniqlo&nbsp; &nbsp; Japan&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2002&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  2009&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  MNC&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Middle customer segment&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Greenfield investment with own flagship stores&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Independent e-commerce site; Online activities for brand awareness.</p>  <p>Björn Borg&nbsp; &nbsp;  Sweden&nbsp;  2011&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  2011&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  MNC&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Middle customer segment&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Joint venture for distribution with&nbsp; Dragon Crowd&nbsp; &nbsp;  Online store Taobao; social media Weibo</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Table 1: Characteristics of the Different Market Entry Strategies for China.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Five Lessons Learned</p>  <p>Foreign companies, both MNC and SME, are able to create value through exchange processes of the electronic market and by obtaining strategic resources, aggregated online shopping consumer base and tailored e-commerce services from the Chinese online shopping platform provider. It is important to note that all companies kept and increased their onsite presence in the Chinese market after they moved online. However, the online dimensions are important given the fact that more and more consumers in China are able and are willing to purchase online. </p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>We identified five lessons learned for firms that will enter China. The first lesson is that you need to consider your specific goal: market testing, providing online services, providing integrated online/onsite customer experiences or enabling onsite with advanced online brand promotion. Specifying your goal will enable you to design the right mix of onsite and online dimensions of your market entry strategy. The second lesson is that you need to consider partnering with a local Chinese agent. Following our four cases we then see that a strategy for going alone with your own online flagship store (as in the case of Uniqlo) will utilize the power of the online platform to create brand awareness. In contrast, having a low profile online presence by either not using your brand name or let your local sales agent manage the online store, you are in the position to test the market for new products without running the risk of cannibalizing your brand name (as in the case of P&amp;G) or enter the market as an unknown company with no brand recognition via a well-known local sales agent (as in the case of De Biasi). Lastly, as in the case of Björn Borg, partnering to very quickly build up brand awareness and social media presence are crucial for a successful market entry. The third lesson deals with timing. Conventional wisdom has it that early market entry is better. Indeed, the P&amp;G case show how they reap the benefits from their long presence in China since 1988. However, also for latecomers there is enough space due to the exponential growth of the markets, as the Björn Borg case reveals. The fourth lesson is that for all firms business and IT capabilities were well aligned. Therefore one was capable of discussing and designing the onsite and online dimensions of the market entry strategy in a balanced way. The fifth lesson is that need to be focused and eager to learn from direct Chinese customer experienc or via customer experiences with their Chinese business partners. This open and learning oriented business approach is a critical success factor for developing and implementing a successful market entry strategy.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Although the discussed companies are very diverse in background and experience, they have in common that they follow a strategy combining and balancing online and onsite presence. It is the careful balancing act between the online and onsite presence in China that will create the next generation winners.?</p>

Movies, music and metadata will be mixed up during the South By Southwest Festival, which kicks off Friday in Austin.<br><br>The 10-day South By Southwest Festival has always been a mashup of movies, music and technology. This year, there's a growing focus on the rise of entertainment apps to help you better enjoy those and other pursuits.<br><br>Movie news and ticketing site Fandango is showing a new movie buzz indicator "Fanticipation" at the Austin festival. By tracking moviegoer interest in new movies on its mobile and Web platform  and early ticket sales  Fandango hopes to provide an early take on weekend box-office performance with the new ranking.<br><br>"There is some degree of excitement that people generate from looking at the results of the box office after the weekend," says Fandango president Paul Yanover. "This allows people to get that same kind of interest without waiting for the box office."<br><br>The new feature will appear on Fandango.com and in a new weekly video series, "Weekend Ticket," in which host Dave Karger will use the Fanticipation data to inform moviegoers of the weekend's most anticipated movies and, subsequently, help pair viewers with the best choice among the new releases. The first episode, to be filmed at SXSW, will include interviews with the cast of The Incredible Burt Wonderstone (including Jim Carrey, Steve Carell and Olivia Wilde). The film has its U.S. premiere Friday night at the festival.<br><br>An upcoming update to Fandango's mobile app will allow the video to play on mobile devices.<br><br>AMC Networks, which owns several cable networks including AMC and Sundance Channel, is announcing Yeah!, a new video streaming service, at the festival. The small start-up-style venture within the company launches with a library of 14 pay-per-rental films ($4.99 for a rental that lasts 30 days, though once you start watching you must finish within 48 hours), each enhanced with cast and filmmaker interviews, trivia and quizzes.<br><br>Initially, the offerings target young male audiences with films such as Natural Born Killers and Reservoir Dogs, but the library will expand with a movie each week. On the way: Caddyshack and Ocean's Eleven.<br><br>Movie lovers can watch now on www.yeahtv.com; the iPad app is due this summer. Additions to Natural Born Killers include new hour-plus interviews with cast members Juliette Lewis and Tom Sizemore. Viewers can go back and forth between the interviews and movie.<br><br>New facts about the movie pop up constantly below the film video. (One Killers example: Some actors and crew ate hallucinogenic mushrooms on the set where the characters do in the film.) Users can share their activity on social networks as well. "We look at this as being an innovative new way to experience the movies that you love and already have a relationship with," says Lisa Judson, general manager of Yeah TV!<br><br>SXSW is "an intersection of entertainment and interactive, but more importantly it's a statement of innovation," Judson says. "It is the perfect place for us."<br><br>Web-based movie company Tugg.com, which bowed last year at SXSW, will be touting new features to help film lovers attract smaller independent and older event-type movies to their local theaters  and assist promoters in connecting with moviegoers; a mobile app is being considered.

Also on the scene: music sharing site Soundcloud will host a party and announce updates to its service.<br><br>And start-up EvntLivewill reveal its plans to integrate mobile devices into live concerts and stream sold-out gigs to smartphones, tablets and computers, creating "a new type of experience for music fans that simulates the experience of actually being there," says co-founder David Carrico. "At a physical concert, you would chat with your friends, purchase merchandise, and see different angles of the show. We are able to bring those experiences to you wherever you are."<br><br>The mix of technology and entertainment at SXSW means "a higher concentration of the pacemakers of technology are there," says Brian Blau, research director in consumer services for research firm Gartner. "In today's world, where we are all hyper-connected through our smart devices and we are trying new things all the time, South By Southwest embodies all of that."<br><br>In the past, apps such as Twitter and Foursquare gained momentum at SXSW. Twitter's recently launched video app Vine is expected to be used my many festival attendees to share experiences  and gain viral traction. New calendar and contact apps such as Evernote Hello (evernote.com) and Tempo (Tempo.ai) might earn followers who test them out to juggle the busy conference, which drew 300,000 attendees across all the festivals last year, according to Austin-based app company Rocksauce Studios.<br><br>Silicon Valley start-up 1World aims for something completely different.

The new app and website (www.1worldonline.com) lets you read opinions on various sides of an issue and vote in polls.<br><br>When you vote, you see how the group of 1World users came down on an issue, with breakdowns by sex, marital status and political alignment (Republican, Democrat, Moderate, etc.). "You can see our society is getting polarized. It's becoming a real problem," says 1World Online CEO Alex Fedosseev. "One of the things we are trying to do is reduce this polarization and help people find some common ground. At least people will be able separate opinions from facts."<br><br>Just as many employees are working on top-notch commentary as on the technology needed to crunch user opinions, he says. At SXSW, Fedosseev says, "we aspire to be like Twitter.  We are confident our technology is going to make a big splash."

1World Online is a Silicon Valley-based start-up providing an innovative social research service to help understanding what people really think on a variety of issues. Inside Investor spoke to CEO&nbsp;Alex Fedosseev about his idea.<br><br>Q: How did you come about 1World Online, and how was it formed?<br><br>A: There are two parts of the story. We were looking for the real opinion gap, problems people cannot solve. And we saw that there is no central platform to find out what people really think about various things or topics. We wanted to find out. Usually, people end up in Google or Wikipedia with their questions and try to make sense of links, but there is still a lack of quantifiable data to see how people react to the news. The second part was pretty simple. I already have been involved&nbsp; in three start-ups which all exited, and then I decided to come up with a content platform. I saw that there was no existing way of expressing what one thinks on the Internet, only surveys or posts out there. What we did was to collect questions and posts and then provide people with choices , supported by data points and expert opinions to get quality answers. Thats how the service was born.<br><br>Q: Who benefits from this?<br><br>A: There is a consumer benefit by learning, but companies like to know what people think and want to break down and process the data. What we see from our studies is that consumer behaviour is not so much determined by age or gender or other statistical factors, but by personality. We are opening a two-way street between consumers and companies.<br><br>Q: Should market researchers like Nielsen be worried?<br><br>A: Yes they should, and in a whole new way. There is a new world of social media, and people provide feedback instantly. There needs to be new instruments to measure this, and additional and multiple sources of data on top of the usual data collected. Results need to be made comparable to understand what people want.<br><br>Q: What have been your accomplishments so far?<br><br>A: We became partners of IBM and Microsoft in big data. Weve got a really good traction here, and there are quite a few programmes running at the moment. We also have corporate customers that are using our services, for example Netg ear and Greenwave, and content providers and multimedia magazines that want to maximise social traffic. We provide a dialogue, which is good for both consumers and for companies, and they like it because they can interact with their customers. Facebook and these things are today used by everybody, but the form of interaction is not always what companies want.<br><br>Q: Are there any plans to go out to other markets such as Asia?<br><br>A: We built out platform so that everyone can participate and thus we also want to provide languages other than English  we already started with Spanish. However, to expand to Asian countries, for example, we need to have a vocal team there that understands the interest and the certain topics of a region. But yes, we want to go there, its only a matter of timing and execution. I did similar things with my previous companies.<br><br>A: Where do you see your company in 2014?<br><br>Q: We are really growing, and I see more and more expert discussions from different countries happening on 1World Online. My ultimate vision, which might take up to three years to realise, would be that we become a fixed part of a popular and international social media platform and provide detailed data on countries and people.

 	 	 	   <p>New York, NY | June 3rd, 2015 -- GoPurpose (<u><a href="http://www.gopurpose.com/" title="Link: http://www.gopurpose.com/">www.gopurpose.com</a></u>), a collective crowd funding platform and social awareness network that does good in an accountable, purposeful way will be launching in June 2015.  Founded by philanthropist  and former investment and wealth management banker, Serena Kao, GoPurpose welcomes individuals, small businesses and social enterprise startups looking to make a positive and sustainable impact around the world to raise money using the GoPurpose websites intuitive tools.  </p><p>Acting as a convenient, easy-to-use vehicle for charities and causes, GoPurpose provides a space to create and advertise the project. The site encourages people to donate or attend fundraising events in exchange for Purpose Points, which can be redeemed for rewards.  Projects looking for promotion through GoPurpose must be socially impactful and transparent but can come from any discipline, and sustainable projects with a focus on collective impact are encouraged.</p><p>I know how difficult it is for startups and small enterprises, which want to have a positive impact on their communities, to get the word out there, said GoPurpose founder and CEO Serena Kao. That is why I started GoPurpose, with the goal of connecting those businesses with the supporters that want to fund them and make positive change a reality in struggling areas of the world.  Kao is an investment banker with experience on the boards of various foundations. She has been volunteering since the age of 11, and her true passion is empowering others to be self-sustainable. Her living philosophy is to create balance and harmony between living well and doing good.</p><p>Geographical distance, communication barriers, and advertising difficulties are no longer obstacles for well-intentioned causes using GoPurpose, whose bilingual platform targets both English-speaking and Chinese-speaking audiences. GoPurpose is also the first crowdfunding platform with the China public fundraising license, a difficult to receive license that will allow corporations and individuals who do business in China to receive tax deductions for their donations.</p><p>The social platform has already begun featuring four pilot projects on either side of the globe: an eco-tourism community and a youth center and library in Cambodia, an after-school program in Atlanta, and a program to empower survivors of sex trafficking survivors in New York. Three of the projects have managed to reach their funding goals and the fourth is currently running.</p><p>The GoPurpose difference is in their due diligence reporting, vetting all projects individually and measuring the impact. Kao and the rest of the GoPurpose team know all project creators personally, and Kao spends time on the ground ensuring each project is real and transparent. Throughout and after the funding process, project creators will be asked to keep their funders informed on the projects progress. The GoPurpose team cares deeply about the projects, striving to ensure 100% funding for all projects, and will even donate personally to show their support for the causes.</p><p>GoPurpose is an innovative crowdfunding platform that empowers social good in a sustainable way.  This summer, they are pleased to announce that their founder and CEO Serena Kao is on a mission to promote a campaign of nurturing successful and dynamic women entrepreneurs making a positive impact in society and doing good. Her goal is to empower more women to be confident and continue to strive for excellence while balancing families, work and fun at the same time.  GoPurpose will also be targeting a series of collaboration and organizing events with designers, universities and women -founded NGOs and foundations to collaborate and support each other.

Utilizing the entire range of possible shutter speeds with the Priolite Hot Sync System allows photographers to shoot with wide-open apertures in sunlit environments, freezing motion of fast moving objects, and enables them to create images difficult or impossible to capture before. The ability to remotely control high-powered battery operated studio strobes anywhere between 17 w/s and up to 1000 w/s per light3 with the Priolite Remote Control opens up endless possibilities for creatives all around the world. </p>    <p>High-powered strobe photography at shutter speeds of up to 1/8000th of a second, combined with the ability to operate any of the Priolite Hot Sync strobes at any power setting and without the need for an outlet, truly represents a quantum leap forward for all owners of Pentax cameras, says Joachim Renschke, the CEO and founder of Priolite GmbH.

It enables Medium Format flash photography in a way impossible before, and with no need for leaf-shutter lenses. The 645Z can now reliably sync at up to 1/4000th of a second, making it the ultimate and most sophisticated tool amongst professionals looking for high resolution, high image quality, and high speed flash photography. Unlike other systems that can sync with flash lights at no more than 1/1600th of a second, Priolites solution is a clear game changer in the world of photography, says Alex Munoz, professional still and motion photographer from Los Angeles, California.</p>    <p><b><u>Special Introductory Offer</u></b><u>4</u><br>1x MBX 500 Hot Sync, 1x RC-HS/P, 1x Reflector 7 Inch, 1x Carrying Case for MBX 500, <b>$1970.00 US</b></p>    <p><b><u>General Pricing and Availability</u></b><br>RC-HS/P for Pentax Cameras, SKU 80-8000-05, <b>MSRP $273.00 US</b><br>MBX 500 Hot Sync, SKU 01-0500-04, <b>MSRP $1,599.00 US</b><br>MBX 1000 Hot Sync, SKU 01-1000-05, <b>MSRP $2,286.00 US</b><br>M-Pack 1000 Hot Sync, SKU 04-1000-03, <b>MSRP $2,286.00 US</b></p>    <p><b><u>Main Features</u></b><br>Support Flash Sync speed on HSS enabled Pentax cameras up to 1/8000th of a second<br>Hot Sync works over the entire power range of the strobe from 17 w/s up to 1000 w/s (MBX/M-Pack 1000 HS)<br>Wirelessly trigger and control Priolite strobes with the Priolite Remote Control (2.4 GHz)<br>Control Priolite strobes in 4 groups with 9 device IDs individually; control modeling lights<br>Provide up to 1000 w/s per light/head with a maximum of 220 full-power flashes per charge (MBX 500 HS)<br>Li-Ion powered (MBX and M-Pack series), no memory effect<br>Made in Germany with a 2 year warranty</p>    <p><b><u>Content</u></b><br>Product introduction and first look video <b><a href="http://priolite.us/pentax_hss">http://priolite.us/pentax_hss</a></b></p>  <p><b><u>Contact</u></b><br>PRIOLITE<br>888.818.7335 (Ext. 800)<br>hss@priolite.us</p><p><b><u>Sales</u></b><a href="http://www.priolite.us"><br>www.priolite.us</a><a href="http://www.priolite-usa.com"><br>www.priolite-usa.com</a>  </p><p><br></p><p>1) Camera must support HSS flash functionality; not all models may be supported at launch<br>2) Depending on the maximum shutter speed of the camera<br>3) Currently the most powerful single head, Hot Sync enabled Li-Ion powered strobe on the market<br>4) Available at participating retailers and only while supplies last.

<div><b><h4>Says Steel Mills to Cut Costs with Higher Trim Quality and Coil Management Efficiency</h4></b></div>Unilux says it is raising the stakes in steel production by adding100 percent knife-circumference viewing and a Level 2 connection to mill computer systems to the <a target="_blank" href="http://unilux.com/display_content.php?pageid=177">EdgeTech edge-trim inspection system</a> to improve the ability to monitor knives for better trimming and coil-management efficiency. EdgeTech combines high-speed, high-resolution video cameras with stroboscopic inspection lighting placed next to strip edges to monitor coil trim quality.<b>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div></div></b><div>Together, the upgrades provide more information in real time to help the operators of expensive, value-added processes make the immediate adjustments needed to maximize yield and profitability, said Mike Simonis, president, Unilux. The 100 percent knife-circumference view gives operators much more time to see the condition of knives on the pulpit and work sides of the coil, make adjustments to hold a specification and verify the results in real time.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Thats critical on a PLTCM line, where a mill can have three coils backed up on a line, he continued. A knife crack can create a weak point that tears an edge, and that needs to be caught as soon as possible. Left undetected, the problem could lead to a web break that will require roll changes and disrupt production flow with unscheduled downtime. Being able to make adjustments or schedule maintenance to change a defective knife can save thousands of dollars. The economics are compelling in markets where profit margins are as tight as specification tolerances.<br> <br></div>  <div>As these actions are taken, the mills computer system can automatically capture images and permanently store all the information in customizable data packs as related to the coil and actions taken. This will enable mill personnel to use the mill computer system to easily locate a defective edge for more efficient re-trimming operation and verify all edges of all coils meet specifications when shipped to customers. Process engineers can also reference the data when developing solutions to specific problems and keep processes flowing.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Inspection for the entire trimming process requires an all-inclusive visual inspection tool that helps a trained operator immediately see and correct a very small condition that could damage an entire coil or several coils in a matter of minutes, Simonis said. Every single coil can have a slight variation. The system allows an experienced operator to see those slight variations and adjust for them immediately.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Additional EdgeTech upgrades include error log documentation, DVR-style image playback and review and vertical camera adjustment that enable operators to compensate for steel gauge changes that may slightly raise or lower the steel relative to the cameras view, giving them full view of the edge.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Unilux inspection systems use strobe lights to visually freeze detailed images of edges and flat surfaces moving at full production speed. Images allow process operators, technicians and engineers to use their knowledge and experience to spot and determine the causes of defects and to implement repair solutions.&nbsp; </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div><b>About Unilux </b></div>  <div>Unilux Inc., headquartered in Saddle Brook, NJ, has 53 years of experience in designing and manufacturing industrial surface inspection lighting systems for the printing, converting, packaging, metals, papermaking and textile industries.

The threshold for entry into API testing is often quite high, especially for testers new to the field. Many newcomers think of APIs as just the libraries used by programs. In realility APIs include any specification defining computer-to-computer interaction.<br><br>Let's start with a brief overview of the technology to try and clarify some of the misconceptions out there. Most Web applications lend themselves very well to the classic three-tier architecture model.<br><br>In this model, the entire application is separated into three parts: the data tier, the logic tier, and the presentation tier. Under ideal circumstances none of the tiers know anything about the platform, technology, or structure of any of the others.<br><br>Any one tier can easily be swapped out as new development (or test) needs arise. Further, it is quite common that each of these tiers runs on a different server, or in the case very large applications on different server nodes each with its own load balancers, firewalls, et c.<br><br>If this model is strictly adhered to, then test automation becomes simple: any of the tiers can be replaced with your choice of a test tool. If during development, the boundaries between the tiers start to blur, testing (as well as future enhancements to the application) becomes more difficult. This is one reason why you always want to get testing involved in the design process as early as possible.<br><br>The logic tier is the API. This is where all of the business logic belongs, and if that is the case then this tier alone makes out the entire API. In certain cases, the logic tier of your application has more complexity, and it is not uncommon that multiple technologies (web server, message queue, et c) will make up this tier.<br><br>An API is an interface intended to be interpreted by a computer. Since the interface boundary has to be technology agnostic, the inputs and outputs are normally text-formatted messages. Text messages may be easy for a human to read in order to interpret the inputs and outputs, but in-depth knowledge of the internals of the application is required to sufficiently test it.<br><br>This is the difference between black-box testing and white-box testing. In black-box testing, the tester is only concerned with the functionality of the overall application, exercising only the inputs and checking the outputs.<br><br>In white-box testing, the tester is much more concerned with internal operations of the application, exercising the individual paths the data can travel through the application.<br><br>API testing normally includes only the white-box testing approach.<br><br>Another difficulty is that testers are used to working from a set of provided business requirements. However, business requirements normally describe use cases at a fairly high level, and do not go down to the level of individual application functions.<br><br>It is not unusual that business analysts are not even aware of low level detail and the amount of granularity that everything has to be broken down into, and are not aware that software is able to be tested at this level.<br><br>Typically, project managers are not concerned with assigning time specifically to developing a rich and detailed API, let alone testing it. Paradoxically, if everything is done correctly, the API is the only place where business rules are coded and enforced. The end-user GUI only displays results and any error messages provided by the API.<br><br>Sadly, because of the above problems, developers are often left with testing their own code, if there is any testing at this level at all. And due to time pressures, unit tests often only glance at the positive tests  the happy path  and more in depth testing is left until later in the project.<br><br>Of course, looking at only the positive paths through the application is not really testing, but only checking that the software fulfils business requirements under the most optimal conditions (see the article Why Test?).<br><br>The GUI usually exposes only part of the overall functionality and by design testers are not able to go really deep into the application code, especially when it comes to testing all the negative test cases. This leaves the internals of the application possibly exposed to all sorts of breakage and attacks by end-users, accidental or malicious.<br><br>Lastly, there are situations where the API is the final product  a public API. A simple Internet search will reveal there are thousands of public APIs for anything from GPS and mapping solutions to locating a radio station that is playing your favourite song right now. However, these APIs expose functionality that the developer hopes or thinks other developers/ users will want. In this case, the tester's role needs also to include a user advocate role, to make sure the offering is complete  everything that any user may need is all there. This is in addition to the multitude of hats, the tester already wears: functional testing, security testing, load testing, et c.<br><br>An excellent guide to follow in this case is the API Hierarchy of Needs. The guide is presented as a hierarchy:<br><br>Putting more effort into API testing leads to a much healthier final product. Ensuring that all data access (read and write) goes only through the API significantly simplifies security and compliance testing and thereby certification, since there is only one interface.<br><br>Ensuring that all the required business rules are being enforced at the API tier allows time for much more complete user-experience tests once the UI is released, and not having to concentrate on testing every single business rule and path through the application near the end of the project. Ensuring that the API offers complete functionality allows for easy future expansion of the application as new business needs arise.

<p>AARP has launched a new research initiative, called Project Catalyst, where the organization will work with partners including Pfizer, UnitedHealthcare, and Georgia Tech to promote an increased focus on users over 50 in digital health research and development. The first project of the new initiative, focused on sleep and activity trackers, is launching at Georgia Tech.</p><p>Technology that is designed well  designed for all  can be used by a 5-year-old and a 95-year-old, alike, Jody Holtzman, senior vice president of thought leadership at AARP said in a statement. We are thrilled about starting this study and commencing the launch of the Project Catalyst program. The goals of Project Catalyst are in direct alignment with the mission of AARP  to identify challenges and determine solutions to improve the quality of life for people as they age.</p><p>The initial research project will be carried out at the Georgia Tech Research Institutes HomeLab. In the study, 80 consumers aged 50 and up will use five different consumer devices to track their sleep and activity over a five week period. The devices in the study will be the Withings Pulse, Misfit Flash, Lumo Lift, Spire, Fitbit Charge and Jawbone Up24.</p><p>The study will evaluate the usability of the devices, as reflected in user surveys, and the effectiveness at the devices in changing users behavior. Findings, which will be available in June 2015, will not rank the devices against one another, but will explain how subjects used different devices and what barriers they encountered.</p><p>Additional research projects will follow, which may include more specific participation from Pfizer and UnitedHealthcare. The two companies will help ensure the learnings of the studies are shared among many healthcare stakeholders.</p><p>With the 50-plus population representing a large portion of the patients who depend on our medicines, we recognize the importance of finding innovative solutions to challenges such as medication management and adherence, Wendy Mayer, vice president of worldwide innovation at Pfizer said in a statement. Project Catalyst has potential to enable collaboration across multiple stakeholder groups with the common goal of delivering the best value, and we look forward to continuing our longtime partnership with AARP.</p><p>AARP says on its website that the projects rely on the guidance, support and expertise of our partners to help design research projects that are both informative and actionable, cutting edge and rooted in science. The organization is also seeking additional partners.</p><p>               </p><p>The goals of Project Catalyst are aligned with UnitedHealthcares commitment to being older Americans partners in a healthier future, Tom Paul, chief consumer officer at UnitedHealthcare, said in a statement. Were grateful for the opportunity to help healthcare technology better meet the needs and wants of consumers 50 and older through this initiative.</p>

<p>The writing has been on the wall for some time.</p><p>Television viewership has plunged while digital impressions have soared.&nbsp;</p><p>Brick and mortars have shuttered while eCommerce has boomed.</p><p>What this means is people are both consuming content <i>and</i> shopping differently.</p><p><br></p><p>This isnt news. This is the same old song weve been listening to for the past decade.</p><p><br></p><p>But what <i>is </i>news is that were almost there. Were getting to the part of the song weve all been waiting for even if we didnt know we were waiting for itthe crescendo.&nbsp; The part where all the little notes, minor swells and brief changes in tempo culminate in something huge and transformative. And its not going to be Pinterest, or Instagram or Conde Nast that hit the high note. Its going to be something at once bigger and simpler and wider reaching. And if you dont believe that, then you havent been listening to the song at all.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Exhibit A:</p><p>Recently, Pinterest made headlines when they announced the imminent arrival of <i>Shoppable Pins</i> in partnership with Shopify, a digital shopping cart company.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>What this means:</p><p>Pinteresta site that hangs its hat on discovery of products, goods and sometimes serviceswill now allow its 70 million users to shop the items they discover.</p><p><br></p><p>Exhibit B:&nbsp;</p><p>Instagram announced the addition of a Shop Now button that will allow featured posts to sell the wares theyre posting about.</p><p><br></p><p>What this means:</p><p>Instagrama photo-sharing Social Media platform composed of 200 million users, is going to monetize its extremely popular moment-sharing solution and finally capitalize on its very engaged user base of content consumers.</p><p><br></p><p>Exhibit C:</p><p>Conde Nasts <a href="http://style.com">style.com</a> is converting to the conglomerates flagship ecommerce platform.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>What this means:</p><p>The readers of Conde Nasts magazines and websites around the globe number in excess of 300 milliona devoted user base that until now hasnt had a focused ecommerce consumer journey. There was no clear and tidy way to convert those eyeballs into sales.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>So what does this <i>all </i>mean? It means the struggle is real. On both sides of the proverbial fence publishers/retailers as well as consumerstheres a need for a seamless content consumption and shopping experience. And theres a veritable arms race going on to provide the right solution. From a consumer standpoint, its all very exciting.</p><p><br></p><p>Because this arms race is going to have much larger historical and cultural significance than being merely another vying for market share. What hangs in the balance has the implication of mass change behind it. And thats what Pinterest, Instagram and Conde Nast are all missing. This is bigger than all of them. This is about a foundational change in the way people <i>behave.</i></p><p><i></i><br></p><p>Those three companies are on the right track, but their solution is still a <i>fenced in</i> solution. Its as if each company has discovered an amazing new technology that could change the world, but instead of sharing the benefits, theyre content to just try to change their tiny corner of the world. This is a major impediment to the potential that this integrated content/commerce technology holds.</p><p><br></p><p>This is why a company like Bringhub is where the real news is. Bringhub has developed a seamless, integrated content/commerce solution that allows anyone with content, from Conde Nast to the your local mommy blogger, to turn that content into a checkout without ever leaving the content or diverting from its consumption. While publishers are in a race to build the most efficient ecommerce fences around their content, Bringhub is tearing them down. For retailers, that means their store can now go anywhere their consumers go to consume content. For Publishers that means ALL of their content now has the potential to become a point of purchase. And for consumers it means were now free to shop anywhere we wantThe emancipation of commerce.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/06/08/buyable-pins-and-shoppable-buttons-what-sellers-need-to-know/">http://venturebeat.com/2015/06/08/buyable-pins-and-shoppable-buttons-what-sellers-need-to-know/</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href="http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2015/04/27/style-com-conde-nast-ecommerce-platform-announcement">http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2015/04/27/style-com-conde-nast-ecommerce-platform-announcement</a></p><p><br></p><p>                                        </p><p><a href="http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/06/instagram-adds-a-shop-now-button.html">http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/06/instagram-adds-a-shop-now-button.html</a></p>
When it comes right down to it, dads enjoy getting their hands dirty  it gives them something to do while mom is tackling other parental duties. &nbsp;Its not fun for parents to deal with wiggly, fussy kids who refuse to have their nose and ears cleaned, but its a job that has to be done! Luckily, theres a tool out there that makes the task a whole lot easier for parents  oogiebear! oogiebear is the <a href="http://www.myoogie.com" target="_blank" title="Link: http://www.myoogie.com">better booger tool</a> designed to remove both wet and sticky, dry mucus (okay we'll say it  boogers!) from babys nose. It even cleans babys ears! Next time the job needs doing, let dad try oogiebear and hell probably ask to do the chore each time!<br><br>oogiebear was developed by pharmacist and mom of three, Nina Farzin. Ninas had plenty of experience cleaning boogers and knows its no day in the park for parents or kids. Surprised there was nothing quite like it out there, she decided to turn her idea into a reality. Her concept of a dual-purpose tool that would safely and effectively clean both nose and ears meant no more tears and no more fuss. The tool has two sides, a loop-end perfect for sticky mucus and a scoop end for safely removing dried mucus. This revolutionary tool is made of soft rubber that's easy for parents to hold and gentle enough for baby. The bear-head design is both fun and safepreventing the oogiebear from going too far into baby's nose and ears.&nbsp; Your baby will breathe easier, and so will you.&nbsp; oogiebear makes cleaning babys nose fun (okay, maybe not fun, but it does work great)!<br><br>I love this product!!...I currently have twin 10-month-old boys who are the epitome of energy, even when they are sick. It is usually a fight to clean their noses when they are sick, but with the oogiebear, I had no problems at all!! The boys even kept still for me to use the oogiebear on them! Even their dad likes to use it, and he hates cleaning their noses!  Meghann Walker<br><br>These little gems are perfect for getting boogies out of baby's nose, as well as, cleaning their little ears without worrying about going in too far. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.  Rob Kirby<br><br>Featured on The Bump, Zulily, The Baby Guy NYC, Keekoo, Baby and Children's Product News, babyMaternity Retailer, Big City Moms, and more, this award-winning product is helping parents and babies everywhere live more comfortably.<br><br>For more information on oogiebear and to purchase visit <a href="http://myoogie.com">http://myoogie.com</a>.<br><br>To schedule an interview with inventor Nina Farzin, contact Giselle Diaz at Giselle@socialmedia22.com or call Tasha Mayberry at 207.317.6099.

WASHINGTON, June 12, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The idea of Father's Day was conceived slightly more than a century ago by Sonora Dodd of Spokane, Wash., while she listened to a Mother's Day sermon in 1909.

<p>In 2002, a struggling artist took a leap of faith and started his own company with only a few hundred dollars. Today, that artist is not only celebrating the tenth anniversary of his award-winning product, but he is giving artists around the globe the chance to do what he did. Terrence Kelleman is realizing his dream through his mighty wallet product line and Artist Collective program.</p><p>Terrence Kelleman founded Dynomighty Design with the idea to create jewelry using magnets. His first design took off after a YouTube video went viral, and sales began to soar. During a flight to LA, Terrence folded a napkin into what would later become the pattern for the Original Tyvek wallet. The only thing missing was a material as creative as the wallet. Enter Tyvek.</p><p>Dynomighty has been creating products from Tyvek since 2005 and has used them to spread positivity and creativity. Besides being eco-friendly, Tyvek products created a canvas for hundreds of designs. In the Spring of 2013, an early iteration of the Artist Collective was launched, and Terrences dream of being able to give back to other artists started to take shape.</p><p>Now, two years later, the Artist Collective hosts over 700 artists, and has given over $50,000 to independent artists through the program. On top of being a platform for artists to share their mighty wallet designs, the Artist Collective serves as a channel for worldwide exposure for the artists.</p><p>Starting in 2015, Dynomighty has set forth a goal to move ten designs into full production twice a year. This commitment to the Artist Collective allows for an artist to become part of the full mighty wallet line that is distributed around the globe in 66 countries, and within over 1600 stores in the US. Independent artists see the value in being part of Artist Collective and Terrence sees the value in giving back to help spread creativity globally.</p><p>While other platforms host artists work and pay commissions, there is no other company opening up their distribution network to help individual artists grow. This endeavor is what Dynomightys motto, Be Mighty!, represents. Often said at trade show booths, and given out on buttons, the motto resounds through everything Terrence has created.</p><p></p><p>The company has already seen growth within Artist Collective this year, and can attribute that directly to the dedication and support of the artists. With more artists joining daily, Artist Collective is set to break the 1000 artists mark this year. The first 10 designs that have been brought into the full mighty wallet line launch this week, and will be available worldwide starting mid-June.</p>

<p>Its common for babies to be colicky, meaning your otherwise healthy baby goes through bouts of uncontrollable crying. Colic may not harm your baby, but it can definitely be stressful for a parent who doesnt know what to do to calm baby. Luckily, the majority of infants are over colic by the age of four months. If you have a colicky baby, there are a couple of things you can do to comfort your baby. Alicia Overby, mom of four and inventor of Baby Elephant Ears, shares her five tips to help.</p><p><br></p><p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp;Soothe baby with warmth</p><p><br></p><p>Babies usually like the feeling of warmth, which is why a nice warm bath can sometimes be enough to comfort baby to sleep. If that doesnt work, try taking a hot water bottle filled with lukewarm (not hot) water and wrap it in a towel. Next you will place the bottle on your stomach and have baby lie down on top of you.</p><p><br></p><p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp;Try a baby support pillow</p><p><br></p><p>Babies are born with weak neck muscles, which is why they need mom and dads help to support their heads. The next time baby is in a stroller, swing, or on a changing table, you can use an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.babyelephantears.com/" target="_blank">infant support pillow</a>&nbsp;to provide baby with some extra comfort. Baby Elephant Ears is a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.babyelephantears.com/" target="_blank">baby headrest</a>&nbsp;that can be used wherever baby goes to provide spinal/neck alignment and comfort.</p><p><br></p><p><img width="400" alt="beepng" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/112592/bee-png" height="267" title="Image: http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/112592/bee-png"></p><p><br></p><p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp;Use a white noise machine</p><p><br></p><p>Infants are used to hearing lots of sounds from inside moms womb, so trying to recreate those sounds in the nursery can be helpful. A white noise machine, running the vacuum, or turning a fan on can all provide gentle whooshing sounds that baby enjoys.</p><p><br></p><p>4. &nbsp; &nbsp;Use rocking motions</p><p><br></p><p>Some babies like to be rocked to sleep and are soothed by gentle, rhythmic motions. Baby swings and rockers are ideal for this but you can also place baby in a sling and walk around the house and bounce baby gently to calm her. Even taking her for a drive in the car around the block just might do the trick.</p><p><br></p><p>5. &nbsp; &nbsp;Swaddle baby</p><p><br></p><p>When all else fails, swaddling is sure to get baby to fall asleep and stay asleep for a longer period of time. Swaddling helps recreate the womb environment so baby feels snug and secure. Just make sure the swaddle is not too tight and that baby doesnt get overheated. </p><p><br></p><p>Note: This release is intended for informational purposes only and not to give professional medical advice.

<div><p>When thinking about child safety, clothes arent typically the first things that come to a parents mind. However, when you learn more about what goes into the manufacturing of your childs clothes, you may realize that they could be harming your childs health. Childrens clothes often come in contact with pesticides, phthalates, and other toxic chemicals that can be damaging to sensitive skin. For National Child Safety Awareness Month, Cutie Bees founder Pooja Songar wants parents to know why they should be more mindful of the clothes they purchase for kids and why Cutie Bees offers the <a href="http://www.cutiebees.com/" target="_blank" title="Link: http://www.cutiebees.com/">healthiest clothes for kids</a>.</p><br><p>The Cutie Bees&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cutiebees.com/" target="_blank">clothing line for baby and toddler</a>&nbsp;was founded by mom of two, Pooja Songar, after she noticed that her daughters skin rashes and eczema were exacerbated by the clothes she was wearing. Some of these clothes were labeled as organic or eco-friendly, but the tags never specified what ingredients went into making them or that no toxic chemicals were used during production. Thats when Pooja did her own research and decided to create a healthy line of her own. Now the Cutie Bees mission is to make kids look good and feel good without compromise.</p><br><p><img width="300" alt="1mvLgbAuzRFJCKWaIX86oz1yGsj4qZTTDRzXMt8fpGQjpeg" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/112592/1mvlgbauzrfjckwaix86oz1ygsj4qzttdrzxmt8fpgq-jpeg" height="300" title="Image: http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/112592/1mvlgbauzrfjckwaix86oz1ygsj4qzttdrzxmt8fpgq-jpeg">&nbsp;<img width="300" alt="MFC2y_MQ5ABBUEvlMMY1KkwOCl0Bxlkkkvwn4Zxvy5gjpeg" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/112592/mfc2y_mq5abbuevlmmy1kkwocl0bxlkkkvwn4zxvy5g-jpeg" height="300"></p><br><p><img width="300" alt="zQ7hMeeSWpsg2H5OlvJKcm6TKxNowK7rzNu1IvRqHAIx9eWyTzOWdx1tuf8Mp__LvQ_lr0NcZPGU2xnCPactQcjpeg" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/112592/zq7hmeeswpsg2h5olvjkcm6tkxnowk7rznu1ivrqhai-x9ewytzowdx1tuf8mp__lvq_lr0nczpgu2xncpactqc-jpeg" height="361" title="Image: http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/112592/zq7hmeeswpsg2h5olvjkcm6tkxnowk7rznu1ivrqhai-x9ewytzowdx1tuf8mp__lvq_lr0nczpgu2xncpactqc-jpeg">&nbsp;<img width="310" alt="cutiebeesjpg" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/112592/cutiebees-jpg" height="360">&nbsp;</p><br><p>Here are five main reasons to choose Cutie Bees clothing:</p><br><p>1.

<p>When bringing a new baby home from the hospital, its important that the nursery is well prepared and safe from any hazards. Many times parents are not aware of common room items that can potentially cause harm to infants. In honor of Child Safety Awareness Month, mom of three, Jennifer Cicci, wants to share these seven hidden hazards so parents can prepare the nursery and keep baby safe at home.</p><p><br></p><p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp;Curtains and blind cords</p><p><br></p><p>When decorating the nursery, beautiful and bright curtains may be on your mind, but parents need to realize that they can be dangerous if they are in babys reach. Cordless blinds should be purchased and the crib should be placed away from the windows.</p><p><br></p><p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp;Crib rail</p><p><br></p><p>Most babies will go through a teething period where they will put their mouths on anything to soothe their sore gums. Unfortunately, many&nbsp;<a href="http://www.babeetalk.com/" target="_blank">crib rail covers</a>&nbsp;are made from synthetic materials that have toxic chemicals. Thats why Babee Talk designed their Eco-Teether® Crib Rail Cover with organic cotton that is free of chemical and toxins so its safe for baby to chew on.</p><p><br></p><p><img width="450" alt="babee1png" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/112592/babee1-png" height="238"></p><p><br></p><p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp;Crib mattresses</p><p><br></p><p>Several mattresses are made with foam, which is required to be treated with fire-retardant chemicals. These chemicals are toxic so its best to invest in a natural crib mattress.</p><p><br></p><p>4. &nbsp; &nbsp;Paint</p><p><br></p><p>Choosing a color scheme for your nursery is one of the most exciting design choices because it lays the foundation for what the rest of your nursery will look like. What parents often dont think about is that some paints and lacquers create toxic emissions when they emit volatile organic compounds (or VOCs). Parents should try to use VOC-free paints or paints with low levels of VOC.</p><p><br></p><p>5. &nbsp; &nbsp;Baby toys&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Youll probably be gifted a bunch of adorable baby toys during your baby shower, but parents need to know that toys should not be kept in the crib while baby is asleep. Furthermore, plastic toys tend to contain phthalates, which are harmful to children. Stick with high-quality,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.babeetalk.com/" target="_blank">eco-friendly baby toys</a>&nbsp;like Babee Talks Eco-Buds® Take-Along Pals.</p><p><br></p><p><img width="250" alt="babee2png" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/112592/babee2-png" height="250"></p><p><br></p><p>6. &nbsp; &nbsp;Furniture&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>A lot of wooden furniture (even cribs) are made of pressed/composite wood that formaldehyde is often used in. Formaldehyde is a carcinogen and asthmagen, so choose solid wood furniture for your nursery.</p><p><br></p><p>7. &nbsp; &nbsp;Baby bedding</p><p><br></p><p>Baby bedding can be exposed to flame-retardant chemicals or pesticides, or even toxic dyes. Babee Talk designs stylish and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.babeetalk.com/" target="_blank">organic baby bedding</a>, from crib sheets to rail covers, to crib skirts.</p><p><br></p><p><img width="300" alt="babee3png" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/112592/babee3-png" height="244"></p><p><br></p><p>To view the full line of Babee Talk products and to purchase visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.babeetalk.com/" target="_blank">www.babeetalk.com</a>. </p><p><br></p><p>Note to the media:&nbsp;Jennifer Cicci is extremely mediagenic and available for TV, radio, newspaper, magazine and other interviews.

<p>Second generation <a href="http://www.sigikid-usa.com/" target="_blank">sigikid</a>&nbsp;owners, Lucian and Eva, have decided to expand their beloved family toy brand to the United States. Beginning where they live in San Francisco, the mom and dad business duo are travelling from coast to coast living in a custom designed teardrop trailer. This will be their home for the next three months while they make stops to see current sigikid retailers, potential new retailers, and best of all, the people they meet along the way in different cities/towns/campgrounds and more! The kitchen area in the back of the trailer has been transformed to showcase all their amazing, unique toys; they literally created a traveling trunk show! The fun part, fans can suggest where they visit next by posting on their interactive tour web page:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sigikid-usa.com/pages/tour" target="_blank">http://www.sigikid-usa.com/pages/tour</a></p><p><br></p><p><img width="400" alt="tourpng" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/112592/tour-png" height="266" title="Image: http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/112592/tour-png">&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>So what is sigikid? </p><p><br></p><p>sigikid toys are very unique,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sigikid-usa.com/" target="_blank">one-of-a-kind plush toys</a>&nbsp;that kids, teens, and even adults love. The family-owned brand with roots dating back 150 years ago officially started in 1968 in Germany with the Gottstein family. They saw an opportunity to change the look of children toys from stiff, to cute and cuddly with lifelike facial expressions  a brand trait that makes sigikid so popular. </p><p><br></p><p>The name came from company&nbsp;founder, Sigrid (her nickname is sigi), and her first child Axel (kid). Now, as a true family business, Axel continues to run the business in Germany while his sister, Eva, handles business development in the US with her husband, Lucian, and their son, Sebastian.</p><p><br></p><p>In today's world, many of our daily interactions are quick-paced and short-lived. We often tend to forget one of the most important human attributes: the ability to play. Our mission at sigikid is to bring back quality toys and the importance of playtime for all." shares Eva Frecea, 2nd generation owner of sigikid. </p><p><br></p><p>From June through August, the tour will not only introduce people to sigikid toys and the incredible family behind the brand, it will raise money for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.everymothercounts.org/" target="_blank">Every Mother Counts</a>, an organization dedicated to making pregnancy and childbirth safe for every mother. A percentage of revenues from all toy sales will be donated to this special charity.</p><p><br></p><p><img width="400" alt="sigikid - 10 donatedpng" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/112592/sigikid-10-donated-png" height="400" title="Image: http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/112592/sigikid-10-donated-png">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>We are so excited to be on the road in our custom sigikid trailer and to be raising money for an important cause.

The rest will be inspired by suggestions from our fans which will add a whole other element of fun and adventure! shares Lucian Frecea. </p><p><br></p><p>sigikid will capture their tour by sharing photos on social media and on their website. Those who spot the sigikid trailer can snap a photo and upload it to social media with #sigikidTourUSA for a chance to win a $100 sigikid gift card every month during the tour, and those who dont see the trailer in person but still want to enter, can do so by sharing the provided image on the tour web page. This way every fan can be part of the tour no matter where they are, adds Eva.</p><p><br></p><p>From June through August 2015, keep your eyes peeled.

SAN FRANCISCO  Plug In America announced today that Nissan will serve as the exclusive automotive sponsor for National Drive Electric Week through 2017. National Drive Electric Week, the largest annual organized gathering of plug-in vehicle drivers, celebrates its fifth anniversary this September with test drives and other activities planned in cities throughout the U.S. and beyond.<br><br>"Nissan is a driving force in the plug-in vehicle industry, with the top-selling electric vehicle, Nissan LEAF, and with investments in charging infrastructure and consumer education," said Tom Saxton, Plug In America's Program Manager for National Drive Electric Week. "Nissan's support of National Drive Electric Week helps Plug In America with our efforts to rapidly increase adoption of EVs of all kinds in cities across the U.S."<br><br>National Drive Electric Week is based on the idea that nothing beats ride-and-drives in clean, quiet and powerful plug-in vehicles for converting gasoline-car drivers to EV owners. The event, designed to showcase the fun, cost-savings and clean-air benefits of plug-in vehicles, was launched in 2011 in 29 cities, growing to more than 150 cities in the U.S. and abroad in 2014. Plug In America, the Sierra Club and the Electric Auto Association team up with local groups to organize events, which typically feature all-electric and plug-in hybrid electric cars from every automaker on the market.<br><br>Nissan and the all-electric LEAF have served as the event's exclusive automotive sponsor since 2013.<br><br>"From the moment we launched Nissan LEAF, we quickly found that LEAF owners are our best salespeople," said Andrew Speaker, Director, Nissan Electric Vehicle Sales and Marketing. "We are continuing to support National Drive Electric Week because this event helps bring owners of LEAF and other EVs together to share their experience and educate consumers on the benefits of driving electric cars."<br><br>With more than 178,000 global sales and more than 80,000 in the U.S., Nissan LEAF is the world's best-selling electric car. LEAF features seating for up to five passengers and boasts an EPA-estimated* driving range of 84 miles on a fully-charged battery and MPGe ratings of 126 city, 101 highway and 114 combined.<br><br>The starting price of a Nissan LEAF is about $22,000** in the United States after the maximum available federal tax credit, and can be lower in states and localities that offer additional credits or rebates. LEAF offers the benefits of lower running costs and less scheduled maintenance. Nissan manufactures LEAF and its battery pack at its plant in Smyrna, Tennessee.<br><br>National Drive Electric Week will take place Sept. 12 through 20.

The threshold for entry into API testing is often quite high, especially for testers new to the field. Many newcomers think of APIs as just the libraries used by programs. In realility APIs include any specification defining computer-to-computer interaction.<br><br>Let's start with a brief overview of the technology to try and clarify some of the misconceptions out there. Most Web applications lend themselves very well to the classic three-tier architecture model.<br><br>In this model, the entire application is separated into three parts: the data tier, the logic tier, and the presentation tier. Under ideal circumstances none of the tiers know anything about the platform, technology, or structure of any of the others.<br><br>Any one tier can easily be swapped out as new development (or test) needs arise. Further, it is quite common that each of these tiers runs on a different server, or in the case very large applications on different server nodes each with its own load balancers, firewalls, et c.<br><br>If this model is strictly adhered to, then test automation becomes simple: any of the tiers can be replaced with your choice of a test tool. If during development, the boundaries between the tiers start to blur, testing (as well as future enhancements to the application) becomes more difficult. This is one reason why you always want to get testing involved in the design process as early as possible.<br><br>The logic tier is the API. This is where all of the business logic belongs, and if that is the case then this tier alone makes out the entire API. In certain cases, the logic tier of your application has more complexity, and it is not uncommon that multiple technologies (web server, message queue, et c) will make up this tier.<br><br>An API is an interface intended to be interpreted by a computer. Since the interface boundary has to be technology agnostic, the inputs and outputs are normally text-formatted messages. Text messages may be easy for a human to read in order to interpret the inputs and outputs, but in-depth knowledge of the internals of the application is required to sufficiently test it.<br><br>This is the difference between black-box testing and white-box testing. In black-box testing, the tester is only concerned with the functionality of the overall application, exercising only the inputs and checking the outputs.<br><br>In white-box testing, the tester is much more concerned with internal operations of the application, exercising the individual paths the data can travel through the application.<br><br>API testing normally includes only the white-box testing approach.<br><br>Another difficulty is that testers are used to working from a set of provided business requirements. However, business requirements normally describe use cases at a fairly high level, and do not go down to the level of individual application functions.<br><br>It is not unusual that business analysts are not even aware of low level detail and the amount of granularity that everything has to be broken down into, and are not aware that software is able to be tested at this level.<br><br>Typically, project managers are not concerned with assigning time specifically to developing a rich and detailed API, let alone testing it. Paradoxically, if everything is done correctly, the API is the only place where business rules are coded and enforced. The end-user GUI only displays results and any error messages provided by the API.<br><br>Sadly, because of the above problems, developers are often left with testing their own code, if there is any testing at this level at all. And due to time pressures, unit tests often only glance at the positive tests  the happy path  and more in depth testing is left until later in the project.<br><br>Of course, looking at only the positive paths through the application is not really testing, but only checking that the software fulfils business requirements under the most optimal conditions (see the article Why Test?).<br><br>The GUI usually exposes only part of the overall functionality and by design testers are not able to go really deep into the application code, especially when it comes to testing all the negative test cases. This leaves the internals of the application possibly exposed to all sorts of breakage and attacks by end-users, accidental or malicious.<br><br>Lastly, there are situations where the API is the final product  a public API. A simple Internet search will reveal there are thousands of public APIs for anything from GPS and mapping solutions to locating a radio station that is playing your favourite song right now. However, these APIs expose functionality that the developer hopes or thinks other developers/ users will want. In this case, the tester's role needs also to include a user advocate role, to make sure the offering is complete  everything that any user may need is all there. This is in addition to the multitude of hats, the tester already wears: functional testing, security testing, load testing, et c.<br><br>An excellent guide to follow in this case is the API Hierarchy of Needs. The guide is presented as a hierarchy:<br><br>Putting more effort into API testing leads to a much healthier final product. Ensuring that all data access (read and write) goes only through the API significantly simplifies security and compliance testing and thereby certification, since there is only one interface.<br><br>Ensuring that all the required business rules are being enforced at the API tier allows time for much more complete user-experience tests once the UI is released, and not having to concentrate on testing every single business rule and path through the application near the end of the project. Ensuring that the API offers complete functionality allows for easy future expansion of the application as new business needs arise.

API stands for Application Programming Interface, which specifies how one component should interact with the other. It consists of a set of routines, protocols and tools for building the software applications.<br><br>The API Testing is performed for the system, which has a collection of API that ought to be tested. During Testing, a test of following things is looked at.<br><br>Exploring boundary conditions and ensuring that the test harness varies parameters of the API calls in ways that verify functionality and expose failures. Generating more value added parameter combinations to verify the calls with two or more parameters. Verifying the behaviour of the API which is considering the external environment conditions such as files, peripheral devices, and so forth. Verifying the Sequence of API calls and check if the API's produce useful results from successive calls.<br><br>Return Value based on input condition - The return value from the API's are checked based on the input condition. Verify if the API's does not return anything. Verify if the API triggers some other event or calls another API. The Events output should be tracked and verified. Verify if the API is updating any data structure.

MYbank, one of Chinas first privately owned online banks, debuted today, promising to provide inclusive and innovative financial solutions at lower cost to under-banked urban and rural consumers and small businesses.<br><br>The upstart start-upwhose investors include , an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Groupis poised to challenge the countrys state-owned banking sector with a pioneering (for China) Web-only business model:&nbsp;an all-digital, branchless banking operation that can serve customers 24/7.<br><br>Chinas government has been encouraging competition in the financial industry to spur the countrys financial industry to modernize, which is seen as increasingly urgent as Chinese consumers rapidly adopt computers and mobile phones to access and purchase a wide variety of services, including financial services. MYbank&nbsp;was one of several privately owned banks to receive a license from the China Banking Regulatory Commission in 2014.<br><br>Chinas state-owned banks have typically focused on the countrys state-owned enterprises and other big businesses. Small- and mid-sized enterprises, entrepreneurs and consumersand particularly residents in Chinas less developed rural areashave been left with few options for obtaining loans and other services.<br><br>Answering to the needs of those who have limited access to financial services in China is our mission, said Eric Jing, the president of Ant Financial who is also MYbanks executive chairman. MYbank is here to give affordable loans for small and micro enterprises, and we are here to provide banking services, not for the rich, but for the little guys, Jing said in a statement issued by the bank to mark its inauguration.<br><br>MYbank will be competing for Chinese savers $7.8 trillion&nbsp;in deposits and a portion of a banking revenue stream thats forecast to double by 2020, Part of the banks strategy is to concentrate on issuing small loans of less than RMB 5 million ($805,500) for small and micro enterprises, entrepreneurs and consumers.<br><br>Jing said MYbank can give out smaller loans profitably because of its lower operational costs. The online-only business model eliminates large expenses associated with maintaining traditional brick-and-mortar branch networks, according to MYbank officials. The bank will also use cloud computing instead of costly internal computer and network infrastructure for data processing.<br><br>MYbank currently has 300 employees, significantly lower than traditional banks. Leveraging our cloud-computing capabilities, our users can apply and pay their loans whenever and wherever on their smart phones, said MYbank Governor Yu Shengfa.<br><br>As part of Ant Financial, which bills itself as Chinas leading online financial services company, MYbank will be a player in Alibaba Groups e-commerce ecosystem, which offers potential synergies unavailable to other private banks. Ant Financial created one of the worlds largest money market funds and launched Chinas first credit agency based on online and offline data . Since 2010, Ant Financials micro-lending subsidiaryAnt Micro Loanhas provided more than RMB 400 billion ($64.4 billion) in loans to more than 1.6 million small businesses. The lenders bad-debt ratio stands at less than 1.5 percent, low for the banking industry.<br><br>Mybank will use big data analysis to develop and tailor financial services for SMEs and individuals, Yu said. We evaluate the credit history of smaller enterprises and determine the lending risks, he said. This is how we ease the borrowing strain on smaller enterprises as we dont only evaluate them on collateral.<br><br>While MYbank poses a challenge to Chinas incumbents, Jing stressed the bank wants to build a platform for an open financial ecosystem by cooperating with other lenders to serve customers that might not fit MYbank. For example, while rural customers are one of the groups targeted by MYbank, the rural population is too large to service alone, so MYbank is open to partnerships with existing rural financial institutions, he said.<br><br>We will recommend our clients to seek financial solutions at traditional banks and we will share our big data, cloud computing and risk control capabilities with our banking peers, Jing said.<br><br>In addition to Ant Financial, MYbank shareholders include Shanghai Fosun Industrial Technology Development Co., Wanxiang Sannong Co., and Ningbo Jinrun Asset Management. The bank said it has registered capital of RMB 4 billion ($644 million).

In its continuing push to give more international merchants access to Chinese consumers, Alibaba Group today said it will launch&nbsp;nearly a&nbsp;dozen&nbsp;country pavilions on the e-commerce giants Tmall Global online marketplace.<br><br>A total of 11 countries including the U.S., New Zealand, Australia, Switzerland, France, Britain, Spain, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Turkey are working with Tmall Global to build out their pavilionsessentially curated, vertical shopping sites designed to promote popular products and authentic specialties from selected SMEs from each country, as well as provide travel and cultural information to Chinas online shoppers. South Koreas government became the first country to launch an official pavilion on Alibabas Tmall.com in May.<br><br>Alibaba Group has been incubating this country pavilion project for some time now, said Jeff Zhang, president of China retail marketplaces for Alibaba Group, calling the 11 sites launched today the first fruit of this ongoing project to make global trade easier. Merchants that are already selling on Tmall.com and Tmall Global marketplaces can opt to join their countrys pavilion if they meet certain requirements, according to Alibaba.<br><br>Alibaba Group in recent months has been aggressively promoting the growth of with government officials and business leaders around the world. Earlier this month, Alibaba Executive Chairman Jack Ma to talk about Alibabas international strategy and how small businesses can use the Web to sell directly to Chinese consumers, who are increasingly looking for high quality, imported products.<br><br>According to a recent report on cross-border e-commerce by Accenture, China is expected to become&nbsp;the&nbsp; by 2020.<br><br>Alibabas group-buying platform, Juhuasuan, also is joining the companys cross-border drive.

Mobile application testing is a process by which application software developed for hand held mobile devices is tested for its functionality, usability and consistency.[1] Mobile application testing can be automated or manual type of testing.[2] Mobile applications either come pre-installed or can be installed from mobile software distribution platforms. Mobile devices have witnessed a phenomenal growth in the past few years. A study conducted by the Yankee Group [3] predicts the generation of $4.2 billion in revenue by 2013 through 7 billion U.S. smartphone app downloads.<br><br>1. Variety of Mobile Devices- Mobile devices differ in screen sizes, input methods (QWERTY, touch, normal) with different hardware capabilities.<br><br>2. Diversity in Mobile Platforms/OS- There are different Mobile Operating Systems in the market. The major ones are Android, IOS, BREW, BREWMP, Symbian, Windows Phone, and BlackBerry (RIM). Each operating system has its own limitations. Testing a single application across multiple devices running on the same platform and every platform poses a unique challenge for testers.<br><br>3. Mobile network operators- There are over 400 mobile network operators in the world;[4] out of which some are CDMA, some GSM, whereas others use less common network standards like FOMA, and TD-SCDMA. Each network operator uses a different kind network infrastructure and this limits the flow of information.<br><br>4. Scripting- The variety of devices makes executing the test script (Scripting) a key challenge. As devices differ in keystrokes, input methods, menu structure and display properties single script does not function on every device.<br><br>1. Functional Testing - Functional testing ensures that the application is working as per the requirements. Most of the test conducted for this is driven by the user interface and call flows.<br><br>2. Laboratory Testing - Laboratory testing, usually carried out by network carriers, is done by simulating the complete wireless network. This test is performed to find out any glitches when a mobile application uses voice and/or data connection to perform some functions.<br><br>3. Performance Testing - This testing process is undertaken to check the performance and behavior of the application under certain conditions such as low battery, bad network coverage, low available memory, simultaneous access to applications server by several users and other conditions. Performance of an application can be affected from two sides:applications server side and clients side. Performance testing is carried out to check both.<br><br>4. Memory Leakage Testing - Memory leakage happens when a computer program or application is unable to manage the memory it is allocated resulting in poor performance of the application and the overall slowdown of the system. As mobile devices have significant constraints of available memory, memory leakage testing is crucial for the proper functioning of an application<br><br>5. Interrupt Testing - An application while functioning may face several interruptions like incoming calls or network coverage outage and recovery. The different types of interruptions are:<br><br>An application should be able to handle these interruptions by going into a suspended state and resuming afterwards.<br><br>6. Usability testing - Usability testing is carried out to verify if the application is achieving its goals and getting a favorable response from users. This is important as the usability of an application is its key to commercial success (it is nothing but user friendliness).[citation needed]<br><br>7. Installation testing - Certain mobile applications come pre-installed on the device whereas others have to be installed from the store. Installation testing verifies that the installation process goes smoothly without the user having to face any difficulty. This testing process covers installation, updating and uninstalling of an application.<br><br>8. Certification Testing - To get a certificate of compliance, each mobile device needs to be tested against the guidelines set by different mobile platforms.<br><br>The Certified Mobile Application Tester popularly known as CMAT certification exam is offered by the Global Association for Quality Management (GAQM) via Pearson Vue Testing Center worldwide to benefit the Mobile Application Testing Community.<br><br>Some tools that are being used to test code quality in general for mobile applications are as follows:<br><br>3.

The new operating theater will allow TDP to offer a wider range of services to its patients, who currently must be sent to other hospitals out of the area for surgical treatment.&nbsp;  </div>  <div>Dick Young, Founder and President of The Denan Project noted, The recognition of the Ethiopian government, at both the national and local levels, for our work in Denan is extremely gratifying. Over the past eleven years we and our partner, the Ogaden Welfare and Development Association, have provided free, quality health services to over 200,000 people in Denan and its adjoining refugee camp. Our patient load continues to grow monthly, and we now are serving those within a 200 kilometer radius. The addition of an operating theater in this very isolated community will give the people of the region a better option for surgeries and other treatments, and, we are confident, save lives. With the ongoing support of the Ethiopian government, we will be better able to meet the needs of the region, and provide a wider array of medical services.</div>  <div>The addition of an operating room with additional beds will also change the official classification in Denan from a health center to a hospital, which will allow the facility to become eligible for newer equipment and various medicines, including anti-venom snakebite medications, of which the local population is in particular need.</div>  <div>Young concluded, We could not be more proud of our organizations work, which is bringing real aid and support to people all over the world. Because TDP is entirely volunteer-funded, we are able to send nearly every cent (over 95%) directly to our projects. Of course, with greater responsibilities come greater need, and we appeal to our supporters to help us ensure that both these new projects announced today can be as successful as possible. The Denan Project was begun by neighbors in the small town of Woodbury, Connecticut who wanted to make a difference in far-away communities.  Anyone wishing to donate or volunteer can go to our website at <a href="http://thedenanproject.org/">http://thedenanproject.org/</a>, and we encourage you to sign up for our newsletter to hear more about our important ongoing work.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>About The Denan Project</div>  <div>The Denan Project (TDP) is a 501(C)(3) Non-Profit Foundation based in Woodbury, Connecticut with the mission of providing health care, education and other critical assistance to highly disadvantaged people living in poor, remote areas of Ethiopia, Peru, Burkina Faso, and Mongolia. Beginning with medical care and then branching out to 1) education, 2) agriculture, 3) water resource development, 4) food security, and 5) microcredit loans, TDP works with regional governments and nongovernmental agencies in the countries they serve in pursuing long term sustainable solutions.

WASHINGTON, July 2, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- As Americans are into their summer travel, nearly 89 million (57 percent) who plan to vacation in a U.S. city say they will use&nbsp;public transportation for at least one activity this summer.&nbsp; More than 156 million Americans in total plan to travel to a top U.S. city this summer (24 percent increase). This continues a trend from recent years. The American Public Transportation Association's (APTA) annual&nbsp;"Travel Like a Local" Summer Travel Survey&nbsp;reports that public transportation will be highly utilized by these travelers looking for the most cost-effective and worry-free form of transportation.&nbsp; <br><br> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			   																																									  Millennials and adults under 45 continue to embrace use of public transit during vacations.&nbsp; Among millennials (18-34) and adults under 45, 68 percent confirmed that they plan to use public transportation during their trip to a major U.S. city or metropolitan area this summer. According to the travel survey, public transportation options make travel more cost effective and stress free for all ages. <br><br> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			   																																									  "As the number of city visitors and tourists continue to increase, public transit systems not only serve as a reliable and affordable way to get around but provide a great way for visitors to experience the local flavor of a community and all that it has to offer," said APTA President  CEO Michael Melaniphy. "In addition, our industry's use of smart phone apps and other tools help visitors easily navigate a city that is new to them."&nbsp; <br><br> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			   																																									  The data show that a city traveler's strongest reason for choosing public transportation is eliminating the need for a parking space with 71 percent of respondents noting this while 67 percent say that it is more affordable than taxis or rental cars. Other reasons included cutting down on the cost of gas (51 percent) and minimizing the stress of driving in an unfamiliar city (55 percent). <br><br> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			   																																									  Forty-eight million vacationers will use public transportation to experience restaurant dining and local nightlife, while 53 million say they will use it while sightseeing. An equal 45 percent of travelers expect to utilize public transit for travel to and from their place of lodging and to and from airports. <br><br> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			   																																									  These travelers are flocking to destinations all across the country.

<p>Beavers, along with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomyidae">pocket gophers</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteromyidae">kangaroo rats</a>, are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castorimorpha">castorimorph</a>  rodents, a suborder of rodents mostly restricted to North America.  Although just two closely related species exist today, beavers have a  long fossil history in the Northern Hemisphere beginning in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene">Eocene</a>, and many species of giant beaver existed until quite recently, such as <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trogontherium">Trogontherium</a></i> in Europe, and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castoroides">Castoroides</a></i> in North America.</p> <p>Beavers are known for their natural trait of building dams on rivers  and streams, and building their homes (known as "lodges") in the  resulting pond. Beavers also build canals to float building materials  that are difficult to haul over land.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver#cite_note-Salvesen-3">[3]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver#cite_note-4">[4]</a>  They use powerful front teeth to cut trees and other plants that they  use both for building and for food. In the absence of existing ponds,  beavers must construct dams before building their lodges. First they  place vertical poles, then fill between the poles with a crisscross of  horizontally placed branches. They fill in the gaps between the branches  with a combination of weeds and mud until the dam impounds sufficient  water to surround the lodge.</p> <div> <div><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Beaverbones.jpg"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Beaverbones.jpg/300px-Beaverbones.jpg" alt="" height="186" width="300"></a> <div> </div></div></div><div><div><div> A beaver skeleton</div> </div> </div> <div> <div><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Beaver_skeleton.jpg"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Beaver_skeleton.jpg/300px-Beaver_skeleton.jpg" alt="" height="190" width="300"></a> <div> </div></div></div><div><div><div> A beaver skeleton</div> </div> </div> <p>They are known for their alarm signal: when startled or frightened, a  swimming beaver will rapidly dive while forcefully slapping the water  with its broad tail, audible over great distances above and below water.  This serves as a warning to beavers in the area. Once a beaver has  sounded the alarm, nearby beavers will dive and may not reemerge for  some time. Beavers are slow on land, but are good swimmers, and can stay  under water for as long as 15 minutes.</p> <p>Beavers are herbivores, and prefer the wood of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaking_aspen">quaking aspen</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populus_sect._Aegiros">cottonwood</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow">willow</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alder">alder</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch">birch</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple">maple</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry">cherry</a> trees. They also eat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedges">sedges</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pondweed">pondweed</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymphaeaceae">water lilies</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver#cite_note-5">[5]</a></p> <p>Beavers do not hibernate, but store sticks and logs in a pile in  their ponds, eating the underbark. Some of the pile is generally above  water and accumulates snow in the winter. This insulation of snow often  keeps the water from freezing in and around the food pile, providing a  location where beavers can breathe when outside their lodge.</p> <p>Beavers have webbed hind-feet, and a broad, scaly tail. They have  poor eyesight, but keen senses of hearing, smell, and touch. A beaver's  teeth grow continuously so that they will not be worn down by chewing on  wood.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver#cite_note-6">[6]</a> Their four incisors are composed of hard orange enamel on the front and a softer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin">dentin</a>  on the back. The chisel-like ends of incisors are maintained by their  self-sharpening wear pattern. The enamel in a beaver's incisors contains  iron and is more resistant to acid than enamel in the teeth of other  mammals.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver#cite_note-NW-7">[7]</a></p> <p>Beavers continue to grow throughout their lives. Adult specimens  weighing over 25 kg (55 lb) are not uncommon. Females are as large as or  larger than males of the same age, which is uncommon among <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal">mammals</a>. Beavers live up to 24 years of age in the wild.</p><br>
<p>This summer, researchers from NASA's Transformational Aeronautics  Concepts Program, Convergent Aeronautics Solutions Project, are entering  the third and final phase of the Vehicle Integrated Propulsion Research  (VIPR) effort to test and evaluate new engine health management  technologies. This research incorporates smart sensors and advanced  diagnostic techniques designed to improve safety and reduce costs.</p>  <p>Improved sensors could identify changes in vibration, speed,  temperature and emissions that are symptomatic of engine problems before  they become serious safety concerns. Displays would then notify ground  crews of potential problems that could be fixed by preventive  maintenance or alert pilots to changes in engine health thereby allowing  time to prevent engine damage in flight.</p>  <p>Over the past several years VIPR researchers have conducted  experiments that introduced foreign material  liquids and particulates   into a high-bypass turbofan engine and simulated engine faults to test  the effectiveness of the new sensors. To reduce risk, all such testing  is conducted on the ground under controlled conditions.</p>  <div>   <div> <div>Oil smoke billows from the right inboard engine of  the C-17 while a probe collects emissions data, one of numerous tests  conducted during Phase I of VIPR engine health monitoring tests.</div>  <div>Credits: NASA Photo / Tony Landis</div>   </div> </div>  <p>NASA is partnering with Air Force Research Laboratory, Federal  Aviation Administration, Boeing Research &amp; Technology, Pratt and  Whitney, General Electric Aviation and Rolls-Royce Liberty Works, with  assistance from the U.S. Geological Survey. Researchers from four NASA  centers  Armstrong, Glenn, Langley, and Ames  are involved in various  aspects of research and testing. The Air Force provided a C-17 cargo  transport plane and two F117 engines  military versions of the  commercial PW2037 used on the Boeing 757.</p>    <p>In December 2011, during a baseline test to lay the groundwork for  more complex experiments, the engine detected simulated faults,  including an oil leak. A second test in early 2013 verified that sensors  could detect actuator faults over a range of operating conditions. In  July, researchers will introduce increasing amounts of simulated  volcanic ash into the engine to assess how early the health monitoring  sensors and their associated software can detect and report a problem.</p><br>

<p>Dallas, Texas -- April 24, 2009 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank" title="Link: http://www.myprgenie.com/">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Massage therapist at Massage Envy, Zane King's change of careers was not forced by the struggling economy. After he lost his sight several years ago, he attended massage therapy school and today works as a licensed massage therapist. Mr. King and three other therapists who are blind -- Diana Alvarez, Bill Thayer and Paul Hughes -- work at the Massage Envy clinic in this Dallas suburb. Many of their clients aren't even aware they are blind. Mr. King argues that he benefits from not seeing well. "Most of the therapy rooms are dimly lit, so sight is not particularly an advantage," he said. "Massage therapists who are blind really rely on touch alone, and of course the right touch is the key element in massage therapy."&nbsp;</p><p>Blind massage therapists are part of a growing trend that makes sense. "Once the client is on the massage table, everyone's body is put together the same way, so you know where all the limbs and muscles are," says Mr. Thayer. "Blindness isn't a drawback." Some massage schools are even teaching blind technique. The owner of the Massage Envy clinic in Addison, Bruce McGovern, says he's open to hiring more blind therapists. "These are talented professionals who know what they are doing, and our clients appreciate their skills," he said. Client Lee Fuqua says he doesn't notice that his therapist, Paul Hughes, is blind. "When people lose one of their senses, their other senses are sometimes amplified," he said. "Paul's sense of touch is incredible."

<p>Dallas, Texas -- May 12, 2009 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Scientists studying music's effects on the brain and body are seeing health-boosting potential, both from listening to and making music. A spokesman for the American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) has said that "passive listening" to music can reduce heart rate and blood pressure, induce a relaxed state and change your mood. Babies in neonatal intensive care units have had improved lung development and nursing ability when exposed to music.&nbsp;</p><p>A 2003 study in Heart &amp; Lung Magazine suggests that listening to music while you work out does more than pass the time and make it enjoyable- it may increase your cognitive function, giving your verbal "muscles" a boost. "At Massage Envy, you'll hear relaxing music during your massage, unless you request otherwise," said C.G. Funk, clinician for Massage Envy, the leading provider of massage therapy in the U.S. "If your impulse is to ask for perfect silence, consider giving the music a try. It just might amplify the soothing effects of the massage." A 2005 European study looked at the heart-bolstering, stress-busting effects of music and found that listening to music slowed breathing patterns in everyone studied. But the change was most drastic in those who had studied music, because they had learned to regulate their breathing with musical phrases.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the AMTA website, drumming is one example of active music making that healthy individuals can use for stress reduction. Active music making involves areas of the brain that guard against dementia and decline. It's frequently listed as an activity you can undertake to help prevent Alzheimer's disease.&nbsp;</p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39. Memberships are available for $49 per month and include a one-hour massage session. Members may also enjoy unlimited additional one-hour massage sessions at the $39 member rate.

<p>Dallas, Texas -- May 15, 2009 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Don't let daily pain keep you from the life you want to live. "A professional massage therapist can help reduce the pain that comes with chronic conditions -- arthritis, fibromyalgia, migraines, and lower back problems," said CG Funk, vice president of industry relations and product development for Massage Envy Limited, the leading provider of massage therapy in the U.S. A study published by the Annals of Behavioral Medicine found that those receiving massages had better-quality sleep and fewer migraine headaches than participants who didn't. Effects lasted up to three weeks after therapy ended. The same study reported that massage therapy was more effective in relieving back pain than acupuncture and spinal modification. It even appeared to reduce the use of painkillers by 36 percent.&nbsp;</p><p>Massage Envy says that massage therapy is a natural and effective pain management solution. Massage therapy can provide all the relief necessary without the need for pain killing drugs. Massage plays an important role in achieving a pain free lifestyle by utilizing various types of massage, such as Swedish, deep tissue, or trigger point therapy. By receiving one of the many massage techniques and modalities, one can rejuvenate and refresh the mind while improving joint movement, and increasing the flow of blood and nutrients to muscles and other tissue.&nbsp;</p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39.

<p>Dallas, Texas -- May 19, 2009 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Nothing says "I love you, Dad" quite like a homemade gift for Father's Day.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some easy projects you can do with your kids.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Take an empty soup or vegetable can, remove the label and clean it well. Tear little pieces of masking tape and place them horizontally around the can, leaving the rough edges. Use a rag to wipe brown shoe polish over the tape, use another rag to wipe off the excess polish. The finished product has the look of leathery bark and makes a great pencil holder.&nbsp;</p><p>Make Father's Day a noteworthy event with a nifty notebook. Help your child cut out construction paper covers and blank inside pages using a cardboard template of something Dad likes, such as a car or a fish. Punch holes in one end and fasten with string.&nbsp;</p><p>Handprints are another favorite. Use water-based paint to place your child's handprint on a piece of paper or card stock. Once the paint is dry, your child can use a marker to write five reasons he or she loves Dad, such as "He takes me to the park." Use the image to create a card or a piece of wall art.&nbsp;</p><p>Not crafty? No worries. Dads love massage too.

<p>Dallas, Texas -- May 26, 2009 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Whether you're a serious athlete or a weekend warrior, you can add some rejuvenation to your workout routine. "A soothing massage can perk you up before or after a workout," said Lance O'Pry, Dallas/Fort Worth regional developer for Massage Envy clinics, the leading provider of massage therapy in the U.S. It's easier to reach your fitness goals with the help of massage, which increases your range of motion, reduces muscle fatigue and helps prevent injury.&nbsp;</p><p>Massage can help maintain flexibility and range of motion by working muscles, connective tissue, tendons and ligaments. It also stimulates production and retention of natural lubricants between connective tissue fibers. It is not often that people associate a massage therapy program with fitness -- but they should for an optimal wellness/fitness program. Ever wonder why most professional teams have massage therapists on staff for their athletes? It is not for relaxation - it is for maximizing the athletes' performance. Athletes who train know their bodies well.&nbsp;</p><p>1.	Toxins and flexibility: After a good workout, a good game, or run, your body has toxins that are embedded within the muscle fibers. A sports massage helps release these toxins thus creating more blood circulation through the muscular system. Not only does increased blood circulation help the athlete perform at their optimal level, a Massage Envy sports massage will increase flexibility creating better results.&nbsp;</p><p>2.	Helps Prevent Injury: Many runners complain of cramps. Cramps are caused by tight muscles not getting enough oxygen. A well trained sports massage therapist at Massage Envy will loosen the runners' tight muscles thus reducing the risk of cramping and injury.&nbsp;</p><p>3.	Healing: When you work out with weights, the weight tears the muscle (this is one of the reasons you are sore the next day). When your body is healing itself (from the tear) pain is often accompanied by the process. One way to help speed up the healing process is a Massage Envy sports massage. This therapy is a type of deep tissue massage that generally focuses on the area of interest for the athlete receiving the massage. It helps speed recovery and repair muscle damage as well as releasing and breaking the knots/adhesions within the muscle. Athletes find this massage not only therapeutic but also mandatory to their fitness regime.&nbsp;</p><p>4.	Boosts Performance: Many athletes work the same muscles over and over thus leading to knots and chronic muscle tension. A regular sports massage therapy program will reduce the athlete's inflammation and help to eliminate scar tissue. The focus is on the deepest layers of muscle tissue, tendons, and fascia (the protective layer surrounding muscles, bones and joints). When the athletes muscles are taken care of, the athlete will perform at their best. Massage Envy offers a variety of massages from relaxation to a sports massage.&nbsp;</p><p>A sports massage is geared toward athletes of every shape size and kind - from the professional athlete to the weekend runner. The massage therapist focuses on particular troublesome areas and to the athlete's sport. This type of massage is growing very quickly in popularity as a useful companion to a balanced training routine. Some athletes use the sports massage prior to an event to loosen muscles to gain maximum performance during training or after a race or event to prevent soreness and help heal the muscles. Athletes have discovered that specially designed massage promotes flexibility, removes fatigue, improves endurance, helps prevent injuries, and prepares them to compete at their absolute best. Massage Envy clinics offer weeknight and weekend hours, so you can rejuvenate on your own schedule.&nbsp;</p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39. Memberships are available for $49 per month and include a one-hour massage session. Members can also enjoy unlimited additional one-hour massage sessions at the $39 member rate.

<p>Dallas, Texas -- June 1, 2009 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Your skin is the largest single part of your body, so it makes sense to keep it clean, moist and healthy. "Massage promotes skin health by improving blood circulation and removing toxins," said CG Funk, vice president of industry relations and product development for Massage Envy Limited, the leading provider of massage therapy in the U.S. That rosy, warm look and feel you get after a massage is a sign of improved blood flow, which brings nutrients and carries away waste products. The stress-relief benefits of massage also can show on your skin. You can also put your best face forward with this summer skin routine:&nbsp;</p><p>1.	Keep It Clean. Start with a cleaning routine. Summer's more humid air helps skin stay hydrated. But with the weather, skin can switch over from dry to oily. Lighter liquid cleansers are better in summer. Summer's heat can lead to perspiration. Sweat contains proteins that need to be washed away so they don't clog your pores. A mild exfoliant is okay, but stay away from cleansers that are too abrasive.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Keep It Moist. Showering can dry out your skin, but applying moisturizer right out of the shower or bath helps to lock in water molecules. For super-soft skin, many people find that the oils and lotions used during regular massage leave their skin feeling well hydrated all over.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Keep It Fresh. To keep your skin looking fresh and clear, alpha hydroxyl creams and lotions or retinol creams can help exfoliate the skin and clean out the pores. Because these products remove the outer layer of skin, they make you more sensitive to the sun, so protect yourself from those rays.</p><p>4.	Keep It Safe. The sun's rays are strongest in summer. Sun protection is very important. Use a broad-spectrum, SPF [sun protection factor] 15 or greater sunscreen that blocks both UVA and UVB rays. Sunscreen is a third line of defense- first is staying indoors when the sun is at its strongest, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., and then using clothing and hats to block the rays.&nbsp;</p><p>Massage Envy states the long term effects of massage therapy are much more than just skin deep. Better circulation is part of the chain reaction that happens in the body as a result of receiving massage therapy on a regular basis. Improved circulation is just one more benefit of massage therapy. Combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise, massage can be the key to leading a healthier lifestyle. Improved Circulation Benefits include: 	Enhances blood flow 	Moves waste away from muscles and internal organs 	Lowers blood pressure 	Improves body function&nbsp;</p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39. Memberships are available for $49 per month and include a one-hour massage session. Members can also enjoy unlimited additional one-hour massage sessions at the $39 member rate.

<p>Dallas, Texas -- June 11, 2009 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- With so much to do, it's easy to neglect your health goals each day. "By adding these easy tasks to the top of your daily to-do list, you'll be making your way to optimal health step-by-step," said CG Funk, vice president of industry relations and product development for Massage Envy, the leading provider of massage therapy in the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>1. Eat right, right away. Breakfast, the most important meal of the day, will jump-start your metabolism, give you immediate energy and help you burn more calories. With all meals, think about food as a rainbow: the more color, the better. Think about eating sweet potatoes instead of white and deep green romaine lettuce over iceberg for starters.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Get off the couch. Some 70 percent of American adults don't get enough physical activity to provide health benefits. The American Heart Association recommends 30 to 40 minutes of vigorous exercise three to five days a week. "Exercise is one of the best things you can do to live longer and better," said Ms. Funk of Massage Envy. Benefits include reduced risk of heart attack and depression, increased late-day energy, improved sleep habits, lower weight and improved self-esteem.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Kick the habit. Smoking causes 440,000 premature deaths each year. Don't be one of them. The benefits of stopping smoking are extraordinary. Simply put, you'll add years to your life.&nbsp;</p><p>4. Laugh. Laughter lowers your blood pressure, increases blood flow to your heart and pumps more oxygen into the blood. A strong sense of humor may even help protect you against a heart attack, according to a study by cardiologists.&nbsp;</p><p>5. Go to bed early. Adequate restful sleep, just like diet and exercise, is critical to good health. According to the National Institutes of Health, healthy adults need an average of eight hours each night.&nbsp;</p><p>6. Regular massage therapy. Massage can also contribute to healthy living. In addition to relieving stress and encouraging relaxation, regular massage therapy can improve circulation, lower blood pressure, improve flexibility and even strengthen the immune system, all of which can positively contribute to a healthy lifestyle.&nbsp;</p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39 - a 40 percent savings - a $65 value. Memberships are available for $49 per month and include a one-hour massage session. Members may also enjoy unlimited additional one-hour massage sessions at the $39 member rate.

<p>Dallas, Texas -- June 16, 2009 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- You probably had more than your share of indoor workouts in the past few months. But with summer in full swing, working out in the great outdoors is a great way to change up your routine. Explore the Area. Plenty of cities and towns have nearby parks and recreation areas that offer bike paths, walking/ hiking paths or other opportunities for outdoor exercise. "Look at your environment and determine what kinds of activities you can do," says CG Funk, vice president of industry relations and product development for Massage Envy, the leading provider of massage therapy in the U.S. Some parks even have workout equipment for doing exercises like pull-ups and step-ups, says Funk. If the park in your neighborhood isn't fully equipped get creative. Use the jungle gym to do various exercises like pull-ups. Just climbing around on a jungle gym is good exercise. Don't overlook the resources at local schools over the summer. "Run up and down the bleachers, use the track for running laps and the grassy areas for stretching; ," Funk says. Stay Home. If you have even a small yard, you can create your own outdoor gym.&nbsp;</p><p>A medicine ball, some exercise bands and a jump rope are all you need to put you through the paces of a good, all around workout. Go Beyond the Basics. Biking, swimming and tennis provide a great workout. But you can also find other kinds of summer fun. If you golf, skip the cart and walk briskly from hole to hole. Or carry your own clubs. Or, how about a nice sailboat ride? Participating in sailing the boat is vigorous exercise. If walking is your thing, look for places to stop and do some body-weight exercises. Use a ledge or bench for step-ups, or do some push-ups in the park. You can find plenty of other opportunities for physical activity, from planting flowers to washing your car- it all adds up.&nbsp;</p><p>Most important, don't waste a moment of the season. Massage can also contribute to healthy living. In addition to relieving stress and encouraging relaxation, regular massage therapy can improve circulation, lower blood pressure, improve flexibility and even strengthen the immune system, all of which can positively contribute to overall fitness.&nbsp;</p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39.

<p>Dallas, Texas -- July 1, 2009 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank" title="Link: http://www.myprgenie.com/">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- If the gloomy economic climate is dragging your morale lower than the Dow Jones Industrial Average, you're not alone. Being optimistic in such a bleak economy may seem like a lost cause, but adopting a more upbeat attitude has its health benefits and is a skill that can be learned through practice.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are a few tips on how to get more pleasure out of life, regardless of your circumstances:&nbsp;</p><p><ul><li>Have an attitude of gratitude. It's one of the easiest and most effective paths to a happier life. It's no coincidence that giving thanks is a foundation of prayer in every religion and culture. Showing gratitude will also make other people feel better about themselves and their situations. If you're stuck on what exactly to be grateful for, take a few seconds before you get out of bed each morning to value the potential in each new day. Tell yourself, "I'm grateful to be here." That thought will improve how you treat yourself and others.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Take a break. Help yourself be more upbeat by scheduling a break in your routine. Have lunch with a friend at your favorite bistro or take a stroll through the farmers market for fresh strawberries. "A lot of our clients will put a massage on their calendars a week ahead of time, just to have something to look forward to," says Lance O'Pry, Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Developer for Massage Envy clinics, the leading provider of massage therapy in the U.S. "Schedulers reap a twofold benefit," he notes. "They get a rush of happiness anticipating the enjoyable event, and they then savor the activity as it happens."&nbsp;</p><p>Help yourself by helping others. Connecting with those who benefit from your effort is a powerful mood booster. There's always someone out there who needs a little help, and helping them out will only help you out. Volunteer at a local pet shelter, library, school or soup kitchen. Ask your community center if you can aid homebound senior citizens by driving them on errands or by just visiting. Fostering personal connections is a powerful antidote to the self-absorption that can overwhelm a person during tough time. There are enough depressing things going on in the world, but even when times are tough, we can create a more upbeat reality for ourselves. Your optimism will be equally infectious. Massage can help you feel better physically and mentally.&nbsp;</p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39. Memberships are available for $49 per month and include a one-hour massage session. Members may also enjoy unlimited additional one-hour massage sessions at the $39 member rate.

<p>Dallas, Texas -- July 6, 2009 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Reflexology, a popular alternative therapy, promotes relaxation, improves circulation, reduces pain, and encourages overall healing. Reflexology is the application of massage techniques and stretching to the feet and hands," says CG Funk, Vice President of Product Development for Massage Envy, the leading provider of massage therapy in the U.S. The theory behind reflexology is that there are "reflex points" on the feet and hands that relate to structures throughout the body - muscles, bones, organs and glands. By stimulating these reflex points through massage techniques, the benefits can be felt throughout the body.&nbsp;</p><p>Reflexology techniques can help reduce pain and discomfort from stress and stress-related conditions inlcuding: 	Tension headaches  Arthritis 	Insomnia 	Sports injuries 	PMS 	Digestive problems, constipation 	Back pain "Reflexology is great by itself or as part of a full-body massage," Funk says. "It's a good idea to book an extra half-hour for your next massage so you can enjoy the added benefits of reflexology." Receiving reflexology shouldn't be painful. If you feel discomfort, be sure to tell the therapist to reduce pressure and work within your comfort zone. Some areas on your feet and hands may be tender, and the therapist may spend extra time on these points.&nbsp;</p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39.

<p>Dallas, Texas -- July 10, 2009 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Summer means letting your feet see the light of day in those comfy-but flimsy-flip-flops. Summer also means your feet will begin to protest the lack of support your favorite flip-flops offer. "Reflexology is a great way to heal your heels," said CG Funk, Vice President of Product Development for Massage Envy, the leading provider of massage therapy in the U.S. "When you go in for your next massage, ask your therapist to pay special attention to your feet. Regular massages keep the feet supple, flexible and in top shape."&nbsp;</p><p>The American Podiatric Medical Association offers these tips on keeping your feet pain-free: Do daily gentle calf stretches for 20 to 30 seconds on each leg. While barefoot, lean forward toward a wall with one foot forward and one foot back.  Wear comfortable, supportive shoes when you anticipate a long day of walking or standing. 	Replace your shoes regularly. 	Avoid walking barefoot on hard or uneven surfaces. 	Break in new shoes before walking in them for long distances.&nbsp;</p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39. Memberships are available for $49 per month and include a one-hour massage session. Members may also enjoy unlimited additional one-hour massage sessions at the $39 member rate.

<p>Dallas, Texas -- July 15, 2009 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Sure, you look forward to your regular massage, but massages have more benefits than you probably realize. "Regular massage keeps the body working at optimal levels," says CG Funk, Vice President of Product Development for Massage Envy, the leading provider of massage therapy in the U.S. "It helps to keep people well-physically and emotionally."&nbsp;</p><p>Here are eight ways massage can benefit your body and mind:&nbsp;</p><p>1. Fight Fibromyalgia Symptoms. Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by muscle pain, fatigue and tenderness. Symptoms can be brought on or worsened by stress and lack of sleep. Massage has helps relieve stress and alleviates muscle pain, discomfort and spasms in fibromyalgia patients. The National Fibromyalgia Association reports that about 40 percent of sufferers have used massage in their treatment plans.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Ease Surgical Effects. After surgery, massage can help get you back on your feet by increasing circulation, relaxing muscles, and improving joint movement and flexibility. Massage promotes tissue regeneration and reduces post-surgical adhesions and swelling.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Improve Your Mood. The relaxing qualities of massage have been shown to help treat anxiety and depression. A review by the Touch Research Institute at the University of Miami School of Medicine, found that massage lowered the body's level of cortisol, a stress hormone, by as much as 53%. Massage is also said to increase the "feel-good" hormones, serotonin and dopamine.&nbsp;</p><p>4. Relieve Headaches. Migraine headaches are often triggered or worsened by stress and poor sleep. In the Annals of Behavioral Medicine, researchers found that people who received massages had higher quality sleeping habits and fewer migraines than people who didn't receive massages. These positive effects even lasted up to three weeks after their massage therapy ended.&nbsp;</p><p>5. Lower Blood Pressure. A study in the journal, Biological Research for Nursing, found that people who had at least three, 10-minute back massages per week lowered their blood pressure more than people who had spent the same amount of time just relaxing.&nbsp;</p><p>6. Increase Flexibility. Massage can help you maintain flexibility and your range of motion by working the muscles, connective tissues, tendons and ligaments, and by stimulating natural lubricants between the connective tissue fibers.&nbsp;</p><p>7. Alleviate Back Pain. A study in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that massage therapy was more effective at relieving back pain than other therapies such as acupuncture and spinal modification. It even appeared to reduce the use of painkillers by 36%.&nbsp;</p><p>8. Curb Carpal Tunnel. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is a painful condition in which the median nerve that connects the forearm and hand becomes pinched at the wrist. Symptoms include burning, tingling or numbness. Treatments usually consist of medication, wrist braces, and surgery. A study from the Journal of Bodywork and Movement reported that carpal tunnel patients receiving regular massage had less pain, reduced symptoms and improved grip-strength.&nbsp;</p><p>Massage Envy therapists are trained in trigger point, deep tissue, and reflexology techniques, as well as cranial sacral therapy. Talk to your therapist about the medical conditions that are affecting you to find out if massage can help. "Massage has many benefits including the promotion of relaxation," says Funk. "And, for those that receive massage on a regular basis, try a style of massage that's new to you, such as a hot stone therapy, cranial sacral therapy or Reflexology at a Massage Envy clinic."&nbsp;</p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39. Memberships are available for $49 per month and include a one-hour massage session. Members may also enjoy unlimited additional one-hour massage sessions at the $39 member rate.

<p>Dallas, Texas -- Aug 5, 2009 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- There's nothing better than a vacation, but without the right planning -- a refreshing vacation can easily turn into a stressful vacation. The wrong vacation can turn out to be just as draining as the work environment the vacation was intended to escape. "It's important that people take the stress out of their vacations," says Lance O'Pry, DFW regional developer for Massage Envy, the leading provider of massage therapy in the U.S. "Too many people try to cram too much stuff into a vacation and wind up exhausting themselves. You've got to take it easy."&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some things you can do to make sure you come back to reality refreshed: 	Start off right -- Decide on the right vacation. If it's a family vacation, get a feel for what everybody wants to do.&nbsp;</p><p>	Build a realistic schedule -- You can't see everything, so don't exhaust yourself trying. Going out of your way to spend a few minutes at every tourist spot is going to wear you out.&nbsp;</p><p>	Rest -- Get some sleep before you take off and try to get sleep every night of your vacation. 	Be healthy -- Always be clean, especially when traveling outside of the country. Don't let a cold ruin your vacation!&nbsp;</p><p>	Free-up time -- Print out your boarding pass ahead of time, pack the car the night before, and do whatever you can to avoid lines and give yourself more time to relax.&nbsp;</p><p> Unwind -- Schedule a massage for the day you return home and give yourself some time to unwind before you restart. You can enjoy the reciprocal benefits of massage anywhere at any of Massage Envy's nationwide locations. With over 500 Massage Envy locations and another 300 set to be established in the next few years, so you'll have no trouble unwinding from a vacation or even starting a vacation.&nbsp;</p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39. Memberships are available for $49 per month and include a one-hour massage session. Members may also enjoy unlimited additional one-hour massage sessions at the $39 member rate.

<p>Dallas, Texas -- August 24, 2009 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Jennifer Smith and Jason Michaels met at the Massage Envy clinic in Rowlett where they work. The rest, as the saying goes, is history. "We started getting to know each other because we had many shifts that overlapped," Jennifer said. "I was drawn to the fact that he was so nice and treated me and everyone with respect. He was also very honest and ethical, and never spoke badly of people behind their backs." "I wasn't really looking for a relationship, I was focused on my career," Jason recalls. "She was pretty, friendly and seemed like a nice person. The more I got to know her the more I realized we had a lot in common." After about two months they went on their first real date -- a great dinner and a nice evening. Both started to wonder if this could be something more. When they went to church together, "that's when I knew there was a deep connection starting to form," Jason said. "I love his smile and his laugh," Jennifer said, "He stays positive about life. He also treats me like nobody else ever has, and I can feel how much he loves me." For Jason, "I love Jennifer's eyes and her laughter. She helps me relax and stay focused on the things in life that are truly important. She has a gentle but firm way that I appreciate so much." The couple picked out a ring in June of 2008. "I was saving up all of my cash tips to pay for it," Jason recalls. "I finally got it [the ring] paid off about a year later, and was looking for the perfect moment to propose." Jason asked Jennifer's parents for their permission after he made the final payment on the ring. He proposed on the Friday before Labor Day weekend. "We went to the pond down the street from my home to relax and feed the ducks," Jennifer remembers. "He was standing there and turned and asked, 'how much do you love me?' Then before I knew it he got down on one knee and pulled out a box with a ring in it and put it on my finger. I was so excited that all I said was 'Jason,' and gave him a big hug. He asked if that was a yes and I just nodded my head and started to cry." "I caught her off guard because I had told her that I couldn't pay off the ring till late September," Jason said. "I wanted the proposal to be a surprise. I had butterflies in my stomach and was stressed, but didn't really realize it until after she said yes. Then I was finally able to breathe and relax." Jennifer and Jason were married May 16, 2009 in Bonham, Texas, at her parents' ranch house. The couple traveled to San Antonio by train for their honeymoon along the River Walk. Rick and April Klics, owners of the Massage Envy clinic in Rowlett, gave the newlyweds the trip as a wedding gift. "The Klics are awesome people," Jennifer said. Jennifer describes their relationship as blissful. "Jason is a great guy and I am so happy I found him. I went looking for a job, and instead I found a career and a life," she said. "She's fun to be around, and is my best friend," Jason says of Jennifer. "I hope it stays this way forever."&nbsp;</p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39.

<p>Dallas, Texas -- Aug 27, 2009 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Bruce McGovern, owner of four Massage Envy clinics throughout the Dallas/Fort Worth area, has recently been recognized as Massage Envy's "Franchisee of the Year." This recognition notes McGovern's financial success, his handling of multiple franchises, and his activity in effective regional advertising campaigns. "There are over 500 Massage Envy clinics nationwide. Mr. McGovern's leadership stood out as the best of the best. He consistently displays excellence in customer service, superb staffing skills and financial success," said Lance O'Pry, Dallas/Fort Worth regional developer for Massage Envy clinics, the leading provider of massage therapy in the U.S. "He is always contributing ideas and works hard to enhance the Massage Envy brand." McGovern's DFW clinics are located at the Old Town Shopping Center, Preston Parker Crossing Shopping Center, Preston Trail Crossing Shopping Center, and the Prestonwood Town Center which he just opened in August of 2008. McGovern's clinics have more than 5,700 members and over 130 employees. "We currently have openings for another 25 licensed massage therapists," said McGovern. "At the rate we're growing we'll be at 200 employees by the end of the year." Combined, McGovern's clinics perform more than 6,700 massages every month. Recently, his Old Town Shopping Center clinic set a Massage Envy record for most massages in one month with 3,237 massages. "My Old Town location was the first Massage Envy clinic to open in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. When I decided to open it, I knew I wanted to be a part of Massage Envy. Our members enjoy the endless therapeutic and stress relieving benefits of massage therapy as often as they like at a fraction of the typical massage price," said McGovern. McGovern also attributes his success to his employees. He states that most of his therapists have more than 5 years of professional experience. "In fact, some of our massage therapists have over 20 years of experience." It's McGovern's attention to the details in customer service, personal attention, marketing, vendor relationships and employee training that has earned McGovern so much success and the new recognition of Massage Envy's Franchisee of the Year award. Additionally, McGovern invests in advertising and expanding awareness of Massage Envy.&nbsp;</p><p>"In 2008, the Dallas/Fort Worth Massage Envy owners pooled our marketing and advertising dollars together and hired The Barber Shop Marketing. The Barber Shop Marketing has advised us to advertise and participate in promotions, cross promotions and public relations this past year when some small businesses have been cutting back. We are seeing great results with this partnership, including new leads, first time visitors and overall sales." When asked what makes him a success, McGovern states, "Don't try to reinvent the wheel. Stick to the basics and make sure that you hire good people that take care of your clients. When you're in a customer service business, like Massage Envy, your customer service is only as good as your weakest link. We are very good at customer service."&nbsp;</p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39.

<p>Sep 2, 2009 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- These days, more and more people are scheduling massage therapy sessions during their lunch breaks, returning to work refreshed and rejuvenated. The lotions used by massage therapists play a major role in the way people feel following a massage session. <br><br>There are two distinctive types of massage lotions â those for home use and those for professional use. Of the professional massage lotions, there are hundreds of products and products lines, each with their own unique ingredients and scents.&nbsp;<br><br>Massage Envy therapists use only Massage Envy approved lotions - Bon Vital, Soothing Touch, and Biotone brand lotions. Each brand has been producing lotions specifically for professional massage therapists for years.&nbsp;<br><br>Since the first Massage Envy clinic opened its doors, they have instilled a âno-aromaâ policy to accommodate clients with allergies.&nbsp;<br><br>âFor sensitive skin it is best to stay away from heavily scented products and ones containing a high amount of oil. The best bet is to request products that are hypo-allergenic, which all Massage Envy clinics use,â says C.G. Funk, vice president of industry relations and product development for Massage Envy, the leading provider of massage therapy in the U.S.&nbsp;<br><br>In addition, the âno-aromaâ policy lends itself to people on-the-go, who might be returning to workplace and want to avoid coating themselves in a disruptive aroma.&nbsp;<br><br>All of the products used at Massage Envy clinics can be purchased at individual Massage Envy clinics.&nbsp;<br><br>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39. Memberships are available for $49 per month and include a one-hour massage session.

<p><i>SourceOne Partners comments on HR outsourcing trend, but warns that satisfaction depends on choosing the right PEO for the business</i></p><p><i>Fort Lauderdale, FL </i>- Business owners and managers throughout the United States are grappling with an increasingly complex regulatory environment with respect to their employees. Concurrently, human resources (HR) departments are coping with more regulations, baby boomers retiring, a new generation of young adults with new expectations, and intense competition when it comes to recruiting top talent. HR must grapple with legal issues, collective bargaining, and federal regulations like the <a href="http://sourceonepartners.com/obamacare-health-care-reform/affordable-care-act-employers-update/" target="_blank">Affordable Care Act (ACA)</a>, while helping the company make the most of its human capital. Partly because of all these HR demands, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/meghanbiro/2013/12/01/top-5-reasons-hr-is-on-the-move/" target="_blank">approximately half</a>&nbsp;of today's businesses outsource some or all of their HR functions.<i><br></i></p><p>The phenomenon of more companies <a href="http://sourceonepartners.comhttp://sourceonepartners.com/peo-services/outsourcing-human-resources-to-a-peo/?utm_source=PRWeb&amp;utm_medium=Press Release&amp;utm_campaign=Outsourcing HR PRpeo-services/outsourcing-human-resources-to-a-peo/" target="_blank">outsourcing more HR functions</a> indicates that businesses understand the intricacy of navigating today's regulatory environment and the risks of mistakes. Outsourcing helps cut costs of back office operations, reduces risks like payroll tax errors leading to problems with the IRS, allows companies to offer better benefit packages, and helps ensure companies remain in compliance with regulations that change frequently. Professional Employer Organizations (PEOs) handle HR functions from payroll to recruiting to workers' compensation for companies of all sizes. But not every PEO is right for every company.<br></p><p><a href="http://sourceonepartners.com/peo-services/selecting-a-peo/?utm_source=PRWeb&amp;utm_medium=Press Release&amp;utm_campaign=Outsourcing HR PR" target="_blank">Selecting the best PEO partner</a> requires that businesses first identify and define their most critical needs. Smaller companies, for example, may outsource all HR functions rather than cope with the overhead of hiring internal staff. Larger companies with in-house HR departments may choose to only outsource selected HR functions. "PEOs are not one-size-fits-all, says Jeff Hecht, President of SourceOne Partners. The perfect PEO for a large corporation may not be right for a small start-up. It's critical that companies evaluate their options and know exactly what they're paying for before signing on with a PEO."<br><br></p><p>With a PEO taking care of <a href="http://sourceonepartners.com/peo-services/hr-solutions/?utm_source=PRWeb&amp;utm_medium=Press Release&amp;utm_campaign=Outsourcing HR PR" target="_blank" title="Link: http://sourceonepartners.com/peo-services/hr-solutions/?utm_source=PRWeb&amp;utm_medium=Press Release&amp;utm_campaign=Outsourcing HR PR">HR functions</a> and ensuring regulatory, tax, and other requirements are met, companies are able to devote more time to critical business functions. Moreover, says Hecht, "With a PEO partner, businesses can often create better benefits packages for employees, making it easier to hire top talent." Other benefits of outsourcing HR functions to a PEO include:<br> <br>  Cost savings - due to economies of scale from PEOs that provide HR services exclusively <br>  Lower risk - because of regulations that change frequently and the effort required to stay abreast of all applicable changes, which is a core function of a PEO<br>  Easier recruiting - for the company that does not have the time or resources to devote to finding, attracting, and hiring top talent<br>  Access to better technology - for recruiting, providing training, and ensuring that payroll and other functions are carried out with maximum accuracy and efficiency<br><br></p><p>About SourceOne Partners</p><p>SourceOne Partners represents PEO brokers and offers customized solutions that fit each individual company's needs.

Funk, vice president of industry relations and product development for Massage Envy, the leading provider of massage therapy in the U.S., "it depends on a number of things."<br><br>Massage therapy not only decreases pain and tension in muscles, it's also great for improving posture, promoting a healthy circulatory system, improving flexibility, relieving stress and strengthening the immune system.&nbsp;<br><br>The type of massage being received, the recommendations of the massage therapist, the physical condition of the client and time and finances, are all factors that determine the number of massages a person should have.&nbsp;<br><br>"For a general recommendation of massage frequency," says Massage Envy's Funk, "I would suggest receiving a massage at least twice a month in order to maintain the effects and results from each session." While Funk gives a general recommendation of two massage sessions per month, receiving massage once a month will still produce great results when scheduled on a regular basis.&nbsp;<br><br>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39.

<p>September 23, 2009 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- While meditation has roots in religion, anyone can benefit from the technique as a method for reducing stress. Combining meditation with other forms of relaxation therapy will have an even greater effect. <br><br>Here are a few therapeutic techniques that, when combined with meditation, will greatly enhance your well-being.&nbsp;<br><br>Massage Massage Therapists urge meditative techniques during therapy sessions to create a more aware perspective. "Sometimes the therapists will have the client focus on their breath as a way of calming and centering, or they may coach the client to visualize a peaceful scene that creates a relaxation response," says C.G. Funk, vice president of industry relations and product development for Massage Envy, the leading provider of massage therapy in the U.S.&nbsp;<br><br>Music &nbsp;Soft, soothing sounds and spirit-nurturing music will create a mood-shifting atmosphere and a nice foundation for a meditative ambience.&nbsp;<br><br>After your massage, you will be super relaxed. When you return home you may want to try finding a quiet place light some candles and focus on your breathing. Focus on positive constructive thoughts. You will be amazed at the difference this will have on your life.&nbsp;<br><br>By itself, meditation will help alleviate stress. When meditation is combined with these other techniques, the health benefits are multiplied.&nbsp;<br><br>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39.

<p>September 28, 2009/ (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) --Back pain can be debilitating, but it can be effectively treated through proper massage techniques and the right plan of attack. Massage therapy reduces the need for painkillers by 36 percent according to a study from the Annals of Internal Medicine. <br><br>Massage therapy alleviates back pain by increasing blood flow, relaxing muscles, releasing endorphins, and restoring flexibility to tense muscles.&nbsp;<br><br>"Massage therapy may make the back quit aching right away, but don't expect one session to cure all the pain," says C.G. Funk, vice president of industry relations and product development for Massage Envy, the leading provider of massage therapy in the U.S. "Your back pain didn't start overnight, so don't expect an overnight cure. However, a solid massage therapy wellness plan can help tremendously."&nbsp;<br><br>Achieving long-term back pain relief depends on a varying number of factors; lifestyle, posture, and the severity of the pain. Sufferers of chronic back pain should develop a plan that includes a massage therapy session every three, to four weeks.&nbsp;<br><br>"It's important to listen to your therapist," says Massage Envy's Funk. "A good therapist will give you homework that you need to stay on top of to get rid of the back pain."<br><br>At Massage Envy clinics, this âhomeworkâ might consist of correcting posture, adjusting living and working spaces, and changing work habits. Exercise should also play a role with massage therapy to achieve maximum relief. Just be sure to consult a physician before embarking on a new exercise program.&nbsp;<br><br>According to a study that appeared in the Feb. 13 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association, total estimated medical costs associated with back and neck pain increased by 65 percent between 1997 and 2005, to about $86 billion a year.&nbsp;<br><br>Massage therapy is an effective and conservative approach when compared to the other options â plus, it feels good.&nbsp;<br><br>Not every Massage Therapist is a back pain expert. When seeking out back pain relief itâs important that the therapist be notified of the condition. At Massage Envy clinics, the front desk personnel are equipped with the knowledge to match clientele with therapists skilled in specific areas. With proper therapy and monitored exercise habits, back pain can be alleviated and even eliminated in the long term.&nbsp;<br><br>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39. Memberships are available for $49 per month and include a one-hour massage session.

<p>October 6, 2009 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- For years, Dave Wilensky has known about the health benefits of therapeutic massage, but what he didn't know was that his weekly Massage Envy appointments would play a role in saving his life.&nbsp;</p>Dave Wilensky frequently schedules appointments with Massage Envy. Kari Robles, massage therapist for Massage Envy has been treating Mr. Wilensky for quite some time.&nbsp;<br><br>After treating Mr. Wilensky week after week at Massage Envy, Ms. Robles noticed the appearance of a suspicious-looking mole on his back and recommended that Mr. Wilensky consult a dermatologist. After a few weeks of diligent urging by Ms. Robles about the seriousness of the issue, Mr. Wilensky left the Massage Envy clinic and made an appointment with a dermatologist.&nbsp;<br><br>Mr. Wilensky was diagnosed with Stage 1 Melanoma. Surgery was performed to remove the tissue and Mr. Wilensky received a clean bill of health.&nbsp;<br><br>The professionalism, knowledge, and care of Ms. Robles, along with her persistence at the Massage Envy clinic, resulted in a potentially life-saving procedure for Dave Wilensky.&nbsp;<br><br>Skin cancer ranks as the most common form of cancer in the United States. It's vital to know the warning signs. For years, dermatologists have used an alphabet list to remind us what to watch for:&nbsp;<br><br>A = Asymmetry. One half doesn't match the other.&nbsp;<br>B = Border. Ragged or ill-defined edges.&nbsp;<br>C = Color. Irregular pigmentation.&nbsp;<br>D = Diameter. Melanomas are usually about the size of a pencil eraser or larger.&nbsp;<br>E = Evolving. The mole changes, including texture or sensation.&nbsp;<br><br>Dermatologists also encourage watching for moles that look or feel different from neighboring moles - darker/lighter, larger/smaller or located in an otherwise clear area.&nbsp;<br><br>âThis was a good story for Mr. Wilensky,â says C.G. Funk, vice president of industry relations and product development for Massage Envy, the leading provider of massage therapy in the U.S. âWe urge our therapists at Massage Envy to inform clients about anything out of the ordinary, but clients shouldnât depend on massage sessions for a diagnosis of other conditions. Weâre glad Mr. Wilensky took Ms. Robles advice.â&nbsp;<br><br>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39.

<p>October 9, 2009 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- While most people realize that massage therapy has many health benefits, many do not realize massage therapy can be a beneficial complementary aspect of a woman's prenatal care regimen. Therapists at Massage Envy locations in DFW have noticed an increase in the number of pregnant women setting appointments for massage therapy sessions. <br><br>As the numbers increase, it has become clear that pregnant women are recognizing massage therapy can reduce stress while promoting general well-being. Pregnancy can be physically grueling and proper massage therapy can relieve many of the natural discomforts that come with carrying a child.&nbsp;<br><br>Therapists at Massage Envy have noted that prenatal patients have found relief from back aches, stiff neck, leg cramps, headaches, and swelling from massage therapy sessions.&nbsp;<br><br>"We get a lot of calls and emails from pregnant women asking about how safe massage therapy is during pregnancy," says C.G. Funk, Licensed Massage Therapist and Vice President of Industry Relations and Product Development for Massage Envy. "The truth is, not only is massage therapy safe, but it can be extremely beneficial. It helps to alleviate a lot of the physical stress of pregnancy."&nbsp;<br><br>In addition to the benefits already mentioned, prenatal massage therapy sessions, like the sessions conducted at Massage Envy clinics, can reduce the stress on weight-bearing joints, increase lymph and blood circulation, help to relax nervous tension, and relieve depression and anxiety caused by changes in hormone levels. Alleviating any or all of these symptoms can result in better sleep patterns and an increase in energy.&nbsp;<br><br>Massage Envy's licensed therapists place all prenatal patients in side-lying positions. A side-lying position eliminates extra strain to the lower back and pelvic area that would be incurred during a massage session in the typical position when pressure is applied. The position of the patient is very important because any extra strain can cause back pain and discomfort. However, for prenatal massage therapy during the first trimester patients may lay on their backs with a slight elevation beneath one hip.&nbsp;<br><br>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39. Memberships are available for $49 per month and include a one-hour massage session. Members may also enjoy unlimited additional one-hour massage sessions at the $39 member rate.&nbsp;<br><br>Log on to <a href="http://www.massageenvy.com">www.massageenvy.com</a> to find the nearest Massage Envy clinic.

<p>October 20, 2009 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com" title="Link: http://www.myprgenie.com">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- When most people think of massage therapy the image they conjure up is typically of the Swedish massage technique. This technique is centuries old and originated in Stockholm, Sweden. According to massage therapists at Massage Envy, most people also mistakenly consider Swedish massage therapy identical to deep tissue massage. <br><br>"We offer many different types of massages including Swedish and deep tissue massage at Massage Envy," says C.G. Funk, Licensed Massage Therapist and Vice President of Industry Relations and Product Development for Massage Envy. "Most people don't realize that there's a difference between Swedish and deep tissue massages. In fact, most people are surprised when our therapists introduce them to all the styles of massage therapy that exist just to address specific symptoms."&nbsp;<br><br>Swedish massage therapy at Massage Envy clinics involves the rubbing of muscles in long, gliding strokes in the direction of the blood returning to the heart. Circular pressure is applied by the hands and palms, along with firm kneading, percussion-like tapping, bending, and stretching&nbsp;<br><br>Deep tissue massage therapy sessions at Massage Envy are similar to Swedish massage sessions, except that the techniques are applied to deeper layers of the muscles. To access these deeper layers, the therapist will oftentimes use other tools besides their hands like forearms or elbows.&nbsp;<br><br>"Massage therapy has been shown to help with many conditions and disorders," says Funk, of Massage Envy. "Deep tissue massage focuses on the deepest layers of muscle tissue hence the name. Clients requesting deep tissue should be aware that the techniques can leave the muscles sore for a few days while they heal and release."&nbsp;<br><br>One of the great benefits of many the many styles of therapeutic massage is that it can increase the level of oxygen in the blood, expel toxins by encouraging circulation, increase flexibility and decrease tension and stress.&nbsp;<br><br>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39. Memberships are available for $49 per month and include a one-hour massage session. Members may also enjoy unlimited additional one-hour massage sessions at the $39 member rate.&nbsp;<br><br>Log on to <a href="http://www.massageenvy.com">www.massageenvy.com</a> to find the nearest Massage Envy clinic.

<p>October 26, 2009/ (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) --Massage therapy is becoming a very important aspect in the healthcare regimen of millions of chronic pain sufferers. While pain and discomfort may be alleviated with one massage session, regular, recurring sessions will have the greatest benefit. <br><br>Some experts even estimate that up to 90 percent of disease is stress related. Eliminating anxiety and stress completely is not a realistic goal, but regular massage therapy can decrease their effects which is what the massage therapists at Massage Envy have set out to do.&nbsp;<br><br>Regular massage sessions from licensed therapists at Massage Envy have been known to generate profound effects among clients suffering from a variety of chronic conditions â both young and old.&nbsp;<br><br>Some examples are:</p><p><p><ul><li>Arthritis sufferers note fewer aches and less stiffness and pain&nbsp;</li><li>Asthmatic children show better pulmonary function and increased peak airflow&nbsp;</li><li>Burn injury patients report reduced pain, itching, and anxiety&nbsp;</li><li>High blood pressure patients demonstrate lower diastolic blood pressure, anxiety, and stress hormones&nbsp;</li><li>Premenstrual Syndrome sufferers have decreased water retention and cramping&nbsp;</li></ul></p><p>As the medical community actively embraces massage therapy, it is becoming an integral aspect of neonatal care as well as hospice programs.

Massage therapy and touch have shown to reduce symptoms from neurological disorders and injuries.&nbsp;</p>"The beauty of massage," says C.G. Funk, Licensed Massage Therapist and Vice President of Industry Relations and Product Development for Massage Envy, "is that while a massage session feels great, there are also many therapeutic benefits.

<p>October 29, 2009 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- As health professionals continually learn more about the human body they are discovering that combining massage therapy with an exercise program will increase the benefits of any exercise. <br><br>Massage therapists at Massage Envy note that proper massage therapy will increase blood flow and create improved circulation throughout the body. Improved circulation causes an increase in oxygen being delivered to the muscles, which then results in increased endurance. The increase in oxygen also causes the muscles and body to expel toxins at a quicker rate and therefore reduces the time it takes the body to recover, also eliminating residual pain.&nbsp;<br><br>Massage therapists at the Massage Envy clinics in Dallas/Forth Worth have noticed a steady increase of athletes making appointments for massage therapy sessions. More and more athletes are including massage therapy as an integral aspect of their exercise regimens.&nbsp;<br><br>"It heightens the results of an athlete's exercise routine," says C.G. Funk, Licensed Massage Therapist and Vice President of Industry Relations and Product Development for Massage Envy. "Anything that gets your blood flowing throughout the body is going to really add to an exercise routine."&nbsp;<br><br>Massage therapy also greatly improves one's range of motion and overall muscle and joint strength, which prevents injuries to the muscles, joints, and tendons.&nbsp;<br><br>"You don't have to be a professional football player," says C.G. Funk of Massage Envy. "Massage therapy is going to enhance any level of exercise routine whether you're getting paid to play or you're just a casual walker."&nbsp;<br><br>Any time new movements are introduced to the body, whether from exercise or natural action, stress and strain are introduced to muscles and joints which can cause stiffness and soreness. The integration of massage therapy sessions into a regular schedule will enhance the benefits of any exercise routine. Massage therapy will also help people maintain their health and general well-being.&nbsp;<br><br>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39. Memberships are available for $49 per month and include a one-hour massage session.

<p>November 3, 2009 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Trigger-point massage, uses cycles of isolated pressure and release to alleviate pain sources. During trigger-point massage therapy sessions at Massage Envy, the client plays an active role through deep-breathing. Clients also play a crucial role in the success of trigger-point massage therapy by identifying the exact location of discomfort. <br><br>The actual "trigger-point" is considered a tight area within muscle tissue that causes pain in other parts of the body. As an example, a "trigger-point" in the back may cause, or trigger, pain in the neck. The neck might then act as a satellite trigger-point, causing pain in the head. The pain could vary from a dull ache to a sharp, intense pain.&nbsp;<br><br>"Basically, a trigger-point pain is caused from muscle overuse, or even injury," says C.G. Funk, Licensed Massage Therapist and Vice President of Industry Relations and Product Development for Massage Envy.&nbsp;<br><br>Trigger-point massage therapy is just one of the many forms of massage therapy offered at Massage Envy that has its own specific function. It is important for anyone considering massage therapy as a solution to any pain, discomfort or illness, that they discuss their symptoms with their massage therapist in order to achieve the most relief possible.&nbsp;<br><br>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39.

<p>November 17, 2009 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Here's a way to enjoy the health benefits of massage therapy before the end of the year: Tap the money in your Flexible Savings Account (FSA). <br><br>Flex accounts are used for healthcare expenses that aren't covered by insurance plans. They help cover the costs of anything from deductibles to eyewear. Many people are unaware that money from a FSA can be used for massage therapy.&nbsp;<br><br>"Our therapists at Massage Envy(R) are finding that more and more clients are using their flex accounts for massage therapy sessions," says Lance O'Pry, Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Developer for Massage Envy, the leading provider of massage therapy in the U.S. "People with flex accounts in their health care plans are trying to use up any excess dollars that otherwise would not carry over into the next year."&nbsp;<br><br>As long as a physician recommends massage therapy with a written prescription, it can be considered a medical expense. An IRS ruling states that medical care expenses must be primarily to alleviate or prevent a physical or mental ailment. Examples of illnesses that qualify include carpal tunnel syndrome, stress, back pain, arthritis, diabetes, hypertension, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, anxiety, depression and chronic pain.&nbsp;<br><br>If you suffer from one of these conditions, tell your medical practitioner you have a Flex Spending Account (FSA) or Health Savings Account (HSA) and that you need a prescription for massage therapy to treat your condition.&nbsp;<br><br>Your physician must provide three pieces of information on the prescription:&nbsp;<br>--Medical necessity: why you need massage therapy (example: to relieve back pain)&nbsp;<br>--Frequency: number of sessions per month (example: minimum of two sessions monthly)&nbsp;<br>--Duration: length of treatment (example: 12 months)&nbsp;<br><br>Once you have obtained the prescription, file it away in case you are ever asked to back up the expense. It isnât necessary to bring the prescription to your Massage Envy.&nbsp;<br><br>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39. Memberships are available for $49 per month and include a one-hour massage session. Members may also enjoy unlimited additional one-hour massage sessions at the $39 member rate.&nbsp;<br><br>Log on to <a href="http://www.massageenvy.com">www.massageenvy.com</a> to find the nearest Massage Envy.

<p>February 9, 2010 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- National Sleep Awareness Week (R) (March 7-13, 2010), the 27 Massage Envy clinics in the DFW Metroplex remind those with sleep problems that regular massage therapy promotes sufficient sleep to allow the body to restore, relax and heal. <br><br>While many understand the benefits of adequate sleep, few realize the major health concerns associated with the lack of quality sleep. More and more studies are showing the relationship between the quantity and quality of sleep and health problems such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension and depression.&nbsp;<br><br>Ongoing massage therapy has been shown to promote high quality, restful sleep by managing two common causes for insomnia: stress and pain. Physically, massage relieves stress by easing muscle tightness and increasing circulation throughout the body. Massage also works on a biochemical level by lowering levels of the stress hormone cortisol and by promoting the release of endorphins. These benefits combine to induce a calm, relaxed state conducive to achieving quality, restorative sleep.&nbsp;<br><br>Additionally, daily stressor's often resurface during night-time hours and interrupt or prevent sleep. Customers receiving ongoing massage therapy from Massage Envy report a sense of mental clarity and an increased ability to turn-off these stressor's and achieve optimal rest and relaxation.&nbsp;<br><br>"Massage therapy benefits sleep on many levels," says C.G. Funk, Licensed Massage Therapist and Vice President of Industry Relations and Product Development for Massage Envy. "Not only does massage feel great physically, but it also helps to reset the mind and establish a state of mental relaxation."&nbsp;<br><br>As the leading massage provider in the U.S., Massage Envy believes that everybody deserves a good night's sleep. That's why they offer affordable massage therapy sessions with flexible appointment times seven days per week to fit even the busiest schedules.

<p>February 16, 2010 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- In an effort to increase employee productivity, job satisfaction and retention, North Texas companies are looking for cost-effective ways to increase the benefits they offer existing and prospective personnel. Dallas/Fort Worth area Massage Envy locations have noticed that many of these companies are beginning to include massage therapy in their wellness programs. <br><br>According to a recent survey by The Conference Board, job satisfaction in the U.S. is at a 22-year low with almost a quarter of those surveyed indicating that they do not expect to be at their current position within a year. Additionally, with more companies slated to move to the Dallas/Fort Worth area and Texas jobs expected to increase by 100,000 in 2010, increasing employee satisfaction and retention is quickly becoming the focus of North Texas companies - particularly smaller companies that are not always financially able to offer the perks of larger firms.&nbsp;<br><br>Massage Envy recommends therapeutic massage as a low-cost benefit that promotes wellbeing in the workplace. Studies show that therapeutic massage not only increases productivity, but promotes employee morale and job satisfaction by:&nbsp;<br><br>* Reducing and relieving stress - both personal and work-related - allowing employees to clearly focus on their professional responsibilities and take more pride in their work.&nbsp;<br><br>* Promoting relaxation to improve mental outlook, ongoing stress management and better handling of high-pressure situations.&nbsp;<br><br>* Providing a rejuvenating experience to foster aptitude for problem solving and enhance calm and creative thinking.&nbsp;<br><br>* Strengthening the immune system to more efficiently fight illnesses, resulting in healthier employees and decreased sick days.&nbsp;<br><br>"Companies are realizing what massage can do for their employees' productivity and overall satisfaction," says Lance O'Pry, Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Developer for Massage Envy. "When you add a low-cost benefit like massage therapy to your wellness program, it helps create good will among your employees. They're happy - even excited - to work for you."&nbsp;<br><br>Employees of Dallas/Fort Worth companies that offer therapeutic massage programs through Massage Envy report that it creates a much happier and healthier working environment. And, they appreciate that Massage Envy caters to busy professionals with 27 locations in the Dallas/Fort Worth area and by offering appointments seven days a week, including late evenings.&nbsp;<br><br>For more information on corporate wellness programs contact Lance O'Pry at lance_opry@sbcglobal.net.&nbsp;<br><br>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39 and an introductory one-hour facial (a 50-minute facial and time for consultation) is just $49. Memberships are available for $49 per month. Corporate memberships are available at a $44 discounted monthly rate.

<p>February 24, 2010 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Two of the Dallas/Fort Worth Massage Envy clinics located in Frisco and Alliance Town Center now offer Spa services that include relaxing, healthy facials. Like massage, facials can help to combat the stressors of everyday life. These stressors can damage the appearance and health of the skin. Regular facials increase circulation, reverse visible signs of aging, improve skin tone and texture and help to eliminate blemishes and breakouts - particularly those attributable to stress. <br><br>Massage Envy Spa's new Murad Healthy Skin Facials feature specially formulated products from world-renowned Murad, Inc. Founded in 1989, the Murad skincare line is based on science-driven The Cellular Water Principle(R), which concludes that skin cells lose the ability to retain water as they age. Murad products are designed to repair cell membranes while attracting water and nutrients to the cells. This unmatched approach makes Massage Envy Spa's Murad Healthy Skin Facials the most effective way to achieve balanced, more youthful-looking skin.&nbsp;<br><br>Massage Envy Spas offer a variety of skin care treatments that benefit every skin type, including:&nbsp;<br><br>* AHA Rapid Exfoliator Anti-Aging Facial - helps to reveal smoother, vibrant, younger-looking skin.&nbsp;<br><br>* Clarifying Enzyme Acne Facial - improves skin clarity, reduce blemishes and soothes inflammation.&nbsp;<br><br>* Environmental Shield Vitamin C Infusion Facial - reverses the signs of aging that result from everyday environmental factors such as sunlight, smog, pollution and stress.&nbsp;<br><br>* Sensitive Skin Facial - repairs and balances the skin with a gentle, yet effective treatment designed specifically to address skin that is easily irritated or sensitive.&nbsp;<br><br>"Massage Envy takes the same dedicated approach to skin care as it does to massage, so our customers know they are in the hands of professionals who understand their needs," says Lance O'Pry, Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Developer for Massage Envy. "And, we are happy to offer yet another service that helps our customers look and feel their best."&nbsp;<br><br>Clients of Massage Envy appreciate the ability to receive affordable massage therapy and facials at one convenient location. And, many report that taking the time to be pampered by Massage Envy professionals leaves them feeling revitalized and refreshed.&nbsp;<br><br>Facials are available at two of the Massage Envy DFW locations: Frisco North at 5105 Eldorado Parkway, Suite 100, Frisco, TX, 75034 (972) 370-3689 and Alliance Town Center, 9630 North Freeway, Fort Worth, TX 76177, (817) 337-7300.&nbsp;<br><br>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39. Members can enjoy a one-hour massage session every month for just $49 plus additional visits throughout the month at reduced prices.

<p>Dallas/Fort Worth Massage Envy Clinics Treat Chronic Pain<br></p><p>March 3, 2010 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Chronic pain affects over 86 million Americans right now. Yet, while it is the top reason cited for doctor visits, it is one of the least effectively treated symptoms in today's healthcare industry. According to Massage Envy, there is a good reason why pain is so hard to measure and treat. <br><br>"The problem is that pain is subjective," says C.G. Funk, Licensed Massage Therapist and Vice President of Industry Relations and Product Development for Massage Envy. "The perception of pain is not a scientifically measurable occurrence like fever, heart rate or blood pressure. Each person experiences pain individually, and even comparable pain is reported differently. For example, when selecting the severity of pain on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the most intense), one patient will rate a broken finger as pain level 10, and another will rate a broken leg as pain level seven."&nbsp;<br><br>Scientific research has proven the enormous benefits of massage therapy - from treating injuries, chronic diseases and neurological disorders to alleviating the tensions of modern lifestyles. Consequently, even the traditional medical community is actively embracing ongoing therapeutic massage as an effective treatment for pain.&nbsp;<br><br>Clients of Massage Envy report that regular massage therapy not only reduces their pain but also alleviates the stress associated with chronic pain, making it easier to manage. Many clients report that massage therapy even helped where painkillers could not.&nbsp;<br><br>"After over nine months of painkillers, MRIs, injections and even surgery - with no relief at all - a friend suggested I try massage," says Michelle Wehrwein, Massage Envy client and Frisco, Texas school teacher. "After the one session, I had next to no pain...for the first time since onset, and I finally feel like I am on the path to recovery. [My therapist at Massage Envy] did what 10 months and 10 specialized doctors could not do."&nbsp;<br><br>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39. Members can enjoy a one-hour massage session every month for just $49 plus additional visits throughout the month at reduced prices. Or, for only $10 more, individuals can enjoy a one-hour healthy skin facial utilizing Murad skincare products at participating locations. Massage Envy gift cards can be purchased at all Massage Envy locations or online and can be redeemed at any clinic in the U.S.&nbsp;<br><br>Log on to <a href="http://www.massageenvy.com">www.massageenvy.com</a> to find the nearest Massage Envy clinic.

Based on objective analysis of various aspects of U.S. franchise businesses - including financial strength, size, business stability and growth - Massage Envy ranked 23rd in the fastest-growing franchises category and 88th in the overall list of 500 companies. <br><br>Not surprisingly, the strength of the Massage Envy franchise is actually a direct result of the current economic downturn. With factors such as increased stress due to employment instability, rising healthcare costs and the general anxiety people feel over the ability to make ends meet, many people are making low-cost therapeutic massage an essential part of their wellness routines.&nbsp;<br><br>Scientific research shows that therapeutic massage relieves stress, boosts the immune system, promotes physical wellbeing and even improves mental outlook. These benefits further promote ongoing stress management, increased aptitude for problem solving and enhanced creative thinking - vital assets in today's economic and social climate. Additionally, more and more companies are including therapeutic massage in their wellness programs as a cost-effect method of increasing employee health, productivity and satisfaction.&nbsp;<br><br>This upswing in interest in therapeutic massage has particularly benefited the Dallas/Fort Worth area locations. In addition to adding two new Massage Envy locations to the Dallas/Fort Worth area, Bruce McGovern, owner of four DFW Massage Envy clinics was awarded Massage Envy Franchisee of the Year for 2009. And, Frank Stockton, owner of the Arlington Highlands Massage Envy location says he saw more first-time prospects than any other Massage Envy clinic in the U.S. last year.&nbsp;<br><br>"We are very excited about the growth of the Massage Envy franchise," says Lance O'Pry, Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Developer for Massage Envy. "The strength of the enterprise nationwide and especially in our region illustrates the importance of therapeutic massage and the Massage Envy franchise model in today's economy."&nbsp;<br><br>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39 and an introductory one-hour facial (a 50-minute facial and time for consultation) is just $49. Memberships are available for $49 per month.

<p>March 24, 2010 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- March 30 is recognized as I am in Control Day - a day for individuals to assess their lives and regain control. People traditionally mark the day by spring cleaning, organizing their office or starting a new exercise program. Massage Envy suggests massage therapy as an easy and affordable way to regain control through reducing stress. <br><br>I am in Control Day was born from the chaos surrounding the events of March 30, 1981 when President Ronald Reagan was wounded in an assassination attempt. Secretary of State Alexander Haig stepped up to the plate amidst the confusion, stating "I am in control here". The quote was taken out of context and many believed that Haig incorrectly interpreted the U.S. Constitution regarding the presidential line of succession. While uproar surrounding the quote eventually led to Haig's resignation, the quote is seen in a much different light today. People now interpret it as a call to action to get their lives under control despite seemingly uncontrollable circumstances.&nbsp;<br><br>Massage therapy helps provide a sense of control by reducing stress levels and promoting ongoing stress management to make individuals better equipped to handle life issues. Additionally, massage therapy promotes relaxation to improve mental outlook, ongoing stress management and better handling of high-pressure situations.&nbsp;<br><br>"Massage therapy offers a reset button for the mind and body that clears the clutter caused by stress," says Lance O'Pry, Dallas/Fort Worth regional developer for Massage Envy. "After a massage therapy session, people find they are better equipped to handle any problem or task at hand."&nbsp;<br><br>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39. Members can enjoy a one-hour massage session every month for just $49 plus additional visits throughout the month at reduced prices. Or, for only $10 more, individuals can enjoy a one-hour healthy skin facial utilizing Murad skincare products at participating locations.

<p>April 7, 2010 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Mother-daughter relationships are some of the most fascinating and complex interactions. For co-owners of the Texas Massage Envy clinic in the Lake Prairie Towne Crossing shopping center in Grand Prairie, mother Sharon Wright and daughter Wendy Wright, the relationship has taken on a whole new dynamic. <br><br>While working as a lawyer in Houston, daughter Wendy Wright had always dreamed of owning her own business. After visiting a local Massage Envy clinic, Wendy had such a positive experience that she began researching franchise opportunities with the company. She found that what appealed to her as a client also made ownership an inviting business prospect -- Massage Envy's dedication to providing affordable, licensed massage therapy to the masses.&nbsp;<br><br>Rather than embark on this new path alone, Wendy approached her mother Sharon and asked her to participate. As a school teacher approaching retirement, Sharon welcomed the idea of partnering with her daughter both to show support and to secure her own financial future.&nbsp;<br><br>Because Sharon is still employed full-time, Wendy primarily runs the business with input from her mother. Upon retirement, Sharon will take on a more prominent role. One of their first decisions was to make the business a true family affair by hiring Misty Clark, Wendy's older sister, as clinic administrator to manage the day-to-day business operations. This decision allows Wendy to handle the bigger picture issues of owning a business, including behind-the-scenes decisions and public promotion.&nbsp;<br><br>"Mom and I both are so proud to be women who are first-time business owners," says daughter Wendy. "It is so exciting to hear clients tell us how great their Massage Envy experience is and to know that we made it possible for them."&nbsp;<br><br>As with any business relationship, conflicts do arise. However, all three agree that family is the most important relationship they share and that it is essential to not let their business disagreements interfere with the quality of their bond outside of the clinic. When differences of opinion arise, they try to take a step back and handle the situation as if they were not related. Wendy believes this approach helps each to avoid over-personalizing the disagreement and enables them all to see the situation objectively.&nbsp;<br><br>"It also helps to spend some personal time together outside of work doing something you all enjoy and not discussing the business," says mother Sharon.&nbsp;<br><br>And speaking of Mother's Day, Massage Envy gift cards make wonderful Mother's Day gifts. Gift cards are available in all denominations. Including the Grand Prairie location, Massage Envy has 27 DFW area clinics.&nbsp;<br><br>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39. Members can enjoy a one-hour massage session every month for just $49 plus additional visits throughout the month at reduced prices. Or, for only $10 more, individuals can enjoy a one-hour healthy skin facial utilizing Murad skincare products at participating locations.

<p>April 16, 2010 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- With over 46 million Americans suffering from arthritis, it is one of the leading causes of disability and high health care costs in the U.S. Massage Envy clinics in the DFW Metroplex offer massage therapy programs that can help individuals cope with the chronic pain of arthritis. <br><br>Arthritis is categorized as a joint disease, mostly affecting the cartilage around the joint. Symptoms of arthritis include pain, swelling and loss of motion in the joint. Most sufferers report that arthritis limits normal activities and significantly decreases quality of life. Unfortunately, there is no cure for arthritis. Sufferers face high healthcare costs and often come to rely on drugs that have little effect on the pain or, worse, cause other health issues.&nbsp;<br><br>The good news is that massage therapy has been shown to be an effective method for combating arthritis symptoms. While many massage therapists have long cited the benefits their clients describe after receiving massage therapy, science is beginning to back these anecdotal reports with clinical evidence.&nbsp;<br><br>In 2006, researchers from Yale Prevention Research Center held a 16-week clinical trial involving 64 individuals with arthritis. The results showed that massage therapy improved flexibility, lessened pain and improved range of motion in the participants. Another study conducted by the Touch Research Institute at the University of Miami - School of Medicine showed that ongoing massage can lower anxiety, reduce pain, and improve grip strength for those with arthritis.&nbsp;<br><br>Massage Envy offers affordable, drug-free relief from arthritis pain. Its Massage Wellness Program for arthritis sufferers is designed to improve joint movement, relax tense muscles, and stimulate the flow of blood and nutrients to the skin and underlying tissues. Additionally, the relaxation achieved through therapeutic massage helps break the cycle of pain and stress that often accompanies and complicates arthritis.&nbsp;<br><br>"Not only does each session feel great, but the therapeutic benefits are compounded when massage is utilized as a frequent therapy," says C.G. Funk, Licensed Massage Therapist and Vice President of Industry Relations and Product Development for Massage Envy.

<p>April 21, 2010 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Massage Envy has selected Stewart Title Southlake Sole Sisters as the winner of its Susan G. Komen Tarrant County Race for the Cure Sponsorship Sweepstakes. The 15-member team will receive a $1000 donation, co-branded team shirts and a free chair massage on race day from licensed therapists in the Massage Envy tent. Additionally, Massage Envy will provide gift cards as prizes for the team members who raise the most money. <br><br>The Tarrant County Affiliate of Susan G. Komen for the Cure is dedicated to combating breast cancer by raising money to fund grants to local hospitals and community organizations that provide breast health education and breast cancer screening and treatment programs for medically underserved women. The first Tarrant County Race for the Cure was held in 1993 and raised $100,000. Today, the race is the largest charitable 5K race in Tarrant County, and the 2009 Race for the Cure had more than 14,000 participants and raised more than $1.5 million.&nbsp;<br><br>The Massage Envy Sponsorship Sweepstakes was created to benefit the 2010 Tarrant County Komen Race for the Cure on April 24 at Sundance Square in downtown Fort Worth. The contest took place from March 16 to April 2 and individuals throughout the Dallas/Fort Worth area nominated teams by posting a 300-word essay on Massage Envy DFW's Facebook page.&nbsp;<br><br>The winning entry was submitted by Jenae Hibbard, a member of the Stewart Title Southlake Sole Sisters from Southlake, Texas. After joining together for team-building exercises for other charity events, the co-ed team members were surprised to learn that many of them have been directly affected by breast cancer -- whether through helping family members and friends battle the disease or even by personally surviving breast cancer. Discovering this information led them to band together again to support a cause that has touched so many lives.&nbsp;<br><br>"Not one more baby should have to give up their mother to this disease and not one more man should lose the love of his life," says Jenae Hibbard. "No one deserves this, so on April 24 we will join together to find away to stop breast cancer from affecting anyone ever again. We will walk for a mother, a wife, an acquaintance, a stranger -- for anyone who has been devastated by this disease."&nbsp;<br><br>To read Jenae's winning essay, visit the Massage Envy DFW Facebook page at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/MassageDFW">www.facebook.com/MassageDFW</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>Massage Envy supports Susan G. Komen for the Cure on many of their events, including a unique annual event called Massage for the Cure. Held each year in the fall, Massage for the Cure is a one-day event that raises money for the organization by offering discounted massages and donating a portion of each massage to Susan G. Komen for the Cure. Many Massage Envy clinics and therapists have donated 100% of all revenue and fees for the day to support the charity.&nbsp;<br><br>"Breast cancer affects the lives of many people in our community," says Lance O'Pry, Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Developer for Massage Envy. "We are proud to support the Tarrant County Race for the Cure and help raise awareness and funds that provide programs and research to help us see the end of this disease."&nbsp;<br><br>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39.

My husband and I walk in memory of his mother who lost her battle to breast cancer in 1997. My best friend Nikki and her husband walk in memory of her grandmother. We are also celebrating our friend Cathy Rosen's second year as a survivor. Nikki and I met (survivor) Ana Moss in the Susan G. Komen 3-Day for the Cure 2008."<br></p><p>Ms. Brosius said the 10-member team is also walking "so our daughters, nieces, and other family members do not have to go through this in their lifetime.

<p>DALLAS, TX -- June 17, 2010 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- When he opened a Massage Envy clinic here in 2005, Bruce McGovern thought the location might produce several hundred thousand dollars in annual revenue.</p><p>&nbsp;It did -- and then some.<br></p><p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.massageenvy.com/" target="_blank">Massage Envy</a>&nbsp;clinic, in the Old Town Shopping Center on Greenville Avenue in Dallas, now generates more than $2 million in annual revenue. The Old Town franchise and River Oaks in Houston are the top two revenue producers for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.massageenvy.com/" target="_blank">Massage Envy</a>, the leading provider of massage therapy in the United States.<br></p><p>McGovern attributes the clinic's growth and success to old-fashioned service. "First and foremost, we want to give the customer the absolute best massage experience they can imagine," he says. "Everything we do is aimed at making the experience better for the client. A wonderful experience for one client attracts others, many of whom are experiencing massage therapy for the first time."<br></p><p>"The attention to customer service is the defining factor in the Old Town clinic's growth, making it one of the top two&nbsp;<a href="http://www.massageenvy.com/" target="_blank">Massage Envy</a>franchises in the United States," said Lance O'Pry, Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Developer for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.massageenvy.com/" target="_blank">Massage Envy</a>.

Members can enjoy unlimited additional one-hour massage sessions at the $39 member rate.<br></p><p>"When you make it comfortable, affordable, and convenient for a client, they keep coming back," says Bruce McGovern.<br></p><p>The market for massage therapy continues to grow, even in a slow economy. An estimated $5-7 billion a year is spent on massage therapy; consumers visit clinics approximately 140 million times a year.<br></p><p><a href="http://www.massageenvy.com/" target="_blank">Massage Envy</a>'s&nbsp;franchising of clinics has produced wide name recognition, making the company the brand name for massage therapy throughout the country.<br></p><p>The percentage of Americans using massage therapists has more than doubled since 1997. Doctors are increasingly recommending massage for their patients.<br></p><p>Massage therapy customers also tend to get massages frequently. Those who seek therapeutic massage from trained professionals average 7 visits per year.

<p>Dallas, Texas -- June 22, 2010 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Breast Friends Forever, a team that walked in the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure last weekend, also won a $1000 contribution for its essay on the team.</p><p>Massage Envy, a long-time race supporter, sponsored two $1000 donations for the best essays on walk teams.<br></p><p>Laurie Brosius of Frisco, a Breast Friends Forever member who wrote the winning essay about her team, saw the race as an opportunity to "walk for the past, present and future."<br></p><p>Ms. Brosius says she and her husband walked in memory of his mother, who lost her battle to breast cancer in 1996. "My best friend Nikki and her husband walked in memory of her grandmother," she said.<br></p><p>The team also celebrated team member Cathy Rosen's second year as a survivor. Teammate Ana Moss is also a survivor. "Nikki and I met Ana in 2008 when we walked 60 miles in the Komen 3-Day, and she has been through breast cancer more than once herself," Ms. Brosius said.<br></p><p>She added that "We are also walking for the future, so that our daughters, nieces and other family members do not have to go through this in their lifetimes. We all have different reasons, but have come together to fight and have a common goal -- to end breast cancer. Together, as Breast Friends, we can do it!"<br></p><p>"We had such an overwhelming response that we could not pick just one team for the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure sponsorship," said Lance O'Pry, Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Developer for Massage Envy, the nation's leading provider of massage therapy. "As a long-time supporter of the Susan G. Komen for the Cure, the DFW Massage Envy clinics were thrilled to sponsor these two deserving teams."<br></p><p>Besides its two $1000 donations,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.massageenvy.com/" target="_blank">Massage Envy</a>&nbsp;also supplied co-branded shirts to the two teams it sponsored. The three members on each team who raised the most money received a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.massageenvy.com/" target="_blank">Massage Envy</a>&nbsp;gift card for a free massage.<br></p><p>At the race, a special area at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.massageenvy.com/" target="_blank">Massage Envy</a>'s tent was reserved for team members to receive a free chair massage from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.massageenvy.com/" target="_blank">Massage Envy</a>therapists.<br></p><p>At&nbsp;<a href="http://www.massageenvy.com/" target="_blank">Massage Envy</a>, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $39.

<p>DALLAS&nbsp;-- Nov 18, 2010 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- The joy of the holidays -- parties, gift-giving, family get-togethers -- can also be stressful. And stress can weaken your immune system, cause headaches, sleep loss, irritability and indigestion.</p><p>To celebrate, not just survive, the holidays, here are some stress-relieving tips from&nbsp;Massage Envy, the nation's leading provider of massage therapy:<br></p><p>Be realistic.&nbsp;One way to lower stress is to lower your expectations. Plan your activities-including shopping, baking and partying-on a master calendar. Stick to your schedule and feel free to say no to things that aren't on it.<br></p><p>Take "me" time.&nbsp;Build in a healthy slice of time to do something just for yourself, whether it's reading a great novel or getting a massage. The DFW&nbsp;Massage Envy&nbsp;centers are offering a free one-hour massage with the purchase of three $60 gift cards beginning Black Friday, November 26, 2010. Gift cards must be purchased at any of the 27 DFW&nbsp;<a href="http://www.massageenvy.com/locations.aspx?radius=250&amp;city=dallas&amp;" target="_blank">Massage Envy</a>&nbsp;locations. &nbsp;<br></p><p>"Massage Envy&nbsp;gift cards are a great idea for friends, family, co-workers and the hostess -- and you can create special time for yourself with our free massage offer," said Lance O'Pry, Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Developer for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.massageenvy.com/locations.aspx?radius=250&amp;city=dallas&amp;" target="_blank">Massage Envy</a>.<br></p><p>Make good choices.&nbsp;Remember, you don't have to do it all. Learn to make good choices, and keep those choices to a minimum, and you will enjoy your holidays.<br></p><p>Go with the flow.&nbsp;You're not perfect the rest of the year, so learn to go with the flow, whether it's because you burned dinner or because your youngest said something inappropriate during dinner. The holiday season is for celebration, not competition.<br></p><p>Practice moderation.&nbsp;Don't overdo. Eating too much, drinking too much and spending too much money will only make you feel worse later. But don't deprive yourself either. Moderation is what's key.<br></p><p><a href="http://www.massageenvy.com/locations.aspx?radius=250&amp;city=dallas&amp;" target="_blank">Massage Envy</a>&nbsp;is open in 42 states, with 638 centers nationwide and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.massageenvy.com/locations.aspx?radius=250&amp;city=dallas&amp;" target="_blank">27 locations in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex.</a><br></p><p>At&nbsp;Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $49.

<p>Dallas, TX -- Jan 20, 2011 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Massage has been around for thousands of years, but myths about the practice still run rampant. Lance O'Pry, Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Developer for <a href="http://www.massageenvy.com/locations.aspx?radius=250&amp;city=dallas&amp;" target="_blank">Massage Envy</a>, sets the record straight about five common massage misconceptions.</p><p>Myth 1: A good massage leaves you sore the next day.<br></p><p>Soreness is no indication of the quality of a massage. "Some people will be sore after their first massage if they've been sedentary," O'Pry says. "Another reason for soreness is if a massage therapist works very deeply to break up lactic acid or trigger points in your body, or if the client fails to drink enough water. But if you get regular massages, chances are you won't be sore the next day."<br></p><p>Myth 2: If I feel fine, I don't need to drink water after a massage.<br></p><p>Drinking water immediately after a massage helps reduce soreness. So does increasing your water intake after your appointment. "Water helps move out waste products that the therapist worked out of your muscles into circulation," O'Pry says. And don't drink alcohol or smoke afterward. Massage increases circulation, so alcohol and nicotine will have a stronger effect after a session.<br></p><p>Myth 3: If you are pregnant, you shouldn't get a massage.<br></p><p>Massage is safe in all trimesters of normal pregnancies and actually can be beneficial. "For normal pregnancies, it's perfectly safe," O'Pry says. "And it feels wonderful-relaxing for mother and baby."<br></p><p>Myth 4: It has got to hurt to really be effective.<br></p><p>"Nothing can be further from the truth," O'Pry says about the no pain, no gain philosophy. "You may experience discomfort, but you should never be in pain." If your therapist is causing pain, say so immediately. "A lot of clients assume a therapist knows when it hurts, but you need to say something," O'Pry says.<br></p><p>Myth 5: Unless my therapist asks, I do not need to bring it up.<br></p><p>It is important to tell your therapist about your health history, including medical conditions, surgeries and medications. "If you have heart disease, are taking antidepressants, have metal in your body, or took a pain reliever an hour before your appointment, we need to know," O'Pry says. "That helps us tailor your massage, determine the depth to use or decide if you should have a massage at all."<br></p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $49. Memberships are available for $59 per month and include a one-hour massage session. Members can enjoy unlimited additional one-hour massage sessions at the $39 member rate.<br></p><p><a href="http://www.massageenvy.com/locations.aspx?radius=250&amp;city=dallas&amp;" target="_blank">Massage Envy in Texas</a>&nbsp;and throughout the country has helped popularize massage.

<p>Dallas/Fort Worth, TX -- Jan 28, 2011 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- With National Sleep Awareness Week coming up March 7-13, 2011, now is the perfect time to really examine personal sleeping habits. While most people do not give sleep much thought, it is very important that one get enough quality, restorative sleep. Besides affecting things like mood and productivity, a lack of quality sleep is associated with major health concerns. More and more studies have shown the relationship between the quantity and quality of sleep and health problems such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension and depression.</p><p>Getting enough good sleep should be a priority in everyone's life. Fortunately, there is something easy and enjoyable that can help improve sleep: massage. Ongoing massage therapy has been shown to promote quality, restful sleep by managing two common causes of sleep issues: stress and pain.<br></p><p>Physically, massage relieves stress by easing muscle tightness and increasing circulation throughout the body. Massage also works on a biochemical level by lowering levels of the stress hormone cortisol and by promoting the release of endorphins.<br></p><p>Additionally, daily stressors often resurface during nighttime hours and interrupt or prevent sleep. Clients receiving ongoing massage therapy from Massage Envy report a sense of mental clarity and an increased ability to turn off these stressors and achieve optimal rest and relaxation.<br></p><p>Massage gets to the root of pain by relaxing tight muscles and addressing trigger points to put a stop to the pain cycle. Massage also increases blood flow to the affected muscles, which brings in healing oxygen and nutrients, and helps remove the waste products of cellular metabolism. All of this activity reduces swelling and stiffness and increases flexibility to help eliminate pain.<br></p><p>These results of massage combine to induce a calm, relaxed state that is more conducive to achieving quality, restorative sleep. Experience all of these benefits and more at Massage Envy.<br></p><p>As the leading massage provider in the U.S., Massage Envy believes that everybody deserves a good night's sleep. That's why they offer affordable massage therapy sessions with flexible appointment times seven days per week to fit even the busiest schedules. And, with 27 locations in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, massage has never been more convenient.<br></p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $49. Memberships are available for $59 per month and include a one-hour massage session. Members can enjoy unlimited additional one-hour massage sessions at the $39 member rate.<br></p><p>Log on to <a href="http://www.massageenvy.com/" target="_blank">www.massageenvy.com</a>&nbsp;to find the nearest Massage Envy center.

<p>Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes, Knees and ToesEntire Body Benefits<br></p><p>Dallas/Fort Worth, TX -- Feb 14, 2011 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank" title="Link: http://www.myprgenie.com/">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- "We live in such a fast-paced society, it is very rare we have a moment to focus on our own bodies," says Lance O'Pry, Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Developer for <a href="http://www.massageenvy.com/" target="_blank">Massage Envy</a>. "That's one of the healing benefits of massage; it's a meditative time to focus inward and relax."</p><p>Regardless of the area of the body, therapeutic massage can reduce tightness and pain and promote healing. Different parts of the body benefit from massage in different ways:<br></p><p>HEAD: Scalp massage can be extremely relaxing. Muscles on the scalp are responsible for making facial expressions, and there can be a lot of tension there, especially when staring at a computer all day or when under stress. Many people feel that tension melt away when their head is massaged.<br></p><p>NECK: You can blame your office job for the stiffness in your neck. Sitting at a desk, staring at a computer, your shoulder blades start rising up, shortening and tightening the neck muscles. Regular massage can help loosen the muscles and prevent stiffening.<br></p><p>HANDS: We use our hands for everything -- typing, clutching the steering wheel, holding the phone, changing a light bulb. Massage feels good because there are so many places to focus on. The thumb pad alone has nine muscles, and the hand is full of trigger points.<br></p><p>BACK: The back is greatly affected by the front. When you sit slumped and don't exercise much, your abs become weak and don't help hold up the spine. Your back has to do extra work to compensate.<br></p><p>ABDOMEN: Closely connected to the back, the muscles in your abdomen need love too. One group in particular, the iliopsoas, pulls on the front of your spine. It's a typical culprit of low-back pain. Another muscle group that can contribute to pain is the deepest back muscle, the quadratus lumborum.<br></p><p>LEGS: Our lower limbs are complex, with several interdependent joints. Knees are easily affected by what's going on in the hips or ankles. Legs also are often prone to injury. Massage therapists at DFW Massage Envy centers are trained to know the range of motion of joints and can help with healing of muscles.<br></p><p>FEET: Foot pain can be life-changing. You might not want to stand, which often prohibits exercise, which can lead to weight gain, perpetuating the cycle. But massage can help bring circulation to the area and even help with mobilization of the foot bones.<br></p><p>Massage Envy is open in 42 states, with 638 centers nationwide and 27 locations in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex.<br></p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $49.

Fortunately, there is something easy and enjoyable that can help improve sleep: massage. Ongoing massage therapy has been shown to promote quality, restful sleep by managing two common causes of sleep issues: stress and pain.</p><p>Daily stressors often resurface during nighttime hours and interrupt or prevent sleep. Clients receiving ongoing massage therapy from<a href="http://www.massageenvy.com/" target="_blank">Massage Envy</a>&nbsp;report a sense of mental clarity and an increased ability to turn off these stressors and achieve optimal rest and relaxation.<br></p><p>Massage gets to the root of pain by relaxing tight muscles and addressing trigger points to put a stop to the pain cycle. Massage also increases blood flow to the affected muscles, which brings in healing oxygen and nutrients. All of this activity reduces swelling and stiffness and increases flexibility to help eliminate pain.<br></p><p>These results of massage combine to induce a calm, relaxed state that is more conducive to achieving quality, restorative sleep.

<p>Plus DFW Massage Envy Centers Offer Great Mother's Day -- Buy 2 Get 1 Free Deal<br></p><p>Fort Worth, TX -- Mar 15, 2011 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- There is something unique about the Alliance Town Center Massage Envyin Fort Worth; it is managed and run by a mother-daughter team.</p><p>Sandi Romero is general manager and her daughter, Candyce Romero, is assistant clinic administrator of the Alliance Town CenterMassage Envy. Sandi began working for Massage Envy in 2010. After hearing her mother's excitement about the company and industry, Candyce jumped at the chance to join her mother when a position opened later that same year.<br></p><p>Both admit that working with family can be challenging. Candyce says, "With my mom and me, our personalities are very similar so sometimes we butt heads." Sandi agrees, saying, "Trust me, we do have the occasional conflict." Both also agree that, difficult as it may be, it is best to put their personal lives aside when it comes to business. Working together requires a different kind of relationship, because there they are not mother and daughter but boss and employee. It is especially difficult for Candyce to think of her mother as boss first and her mother second at work, stating, "She puts me in check really fast when I cross the line handling business conflicts."<br></p><p>Sandi also worries that other employees might think Candyce "gets a break" because of their relationship, but notes, in actuality, "I am the toughest on her because I expect her to be the best and demand it of her." Candyce knows it: "I think my mom is probably harder on me than any other employee."<br></p><p>Despite the challenges, both immensely enjoy working together at Massage Envy. Mother and daughter agree that working together has strengthened their already close relationship and created a mutual professional respect between them. Mother Sandi says she enjoys watching her daughter grow professionally, and Candyce says she feels lucky to be able to work with her mother and learn so much from her.<br></p><p>Sandi and Candyce both greatly appreciate the work they do at Massage Envy. They get great satisfaction knowing they help clients feel better. "Understanding that massage therapy has true health benefits and knowing that we have helped our clients is really rewarding," Sandi acknowledges. She and Candyce are thankful to Massage Envy for bringing them even closer together and allowing them to learn so much from each other. Candyce says she is very excited about the future at Massage Envy.<br></p><p>Remember Mother's Day is May 8.

<p>Dallas/Fort Worth, TX -- Mar 22, 2011 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Massage Envy continues to climb the rankings on Entrepreneurmagazine's 2011 Franchise 500 list. The company ranked 64th overall (up from 88th last year) and 49th in the fastest growing franchise category.</p><p>There are 27 Dallas/Ft. Worth area locations, including four centers owned by Massage Envy's Franchisee of the Year. In the last year, DFW area centers,</p><p><ul><li>Performed 565,135 massages</li><li>Serviced 48,451 members</li><li>Saw a 20 percent increase in sales</li></ul></p><p>"Our DFW sales were huge -- a record last year," says Lance O'Pry, Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Developer for Massage Envy. "Due to the success of our core services, we have added additional services, for example aromatherapy massage and deep heat muscle therapy. And we continue to hire across the region - managers, front desk, and licensed massage therapists." </p><p>While the strength of the Massage Envy franchise appears to contrast sharply with the lingering economic malaise in the U.S., some economy-related stressors have actually boosted Massage Envy's appeal.<br></p><p>For example, stress-inducing job uncertainty and anxiety over making ends meet have caused many Americans to include low-cost therapeutic massage as an essential routine for staying well.<br></p><p>Additionally, more companies are including therapeutic massage in their wellness programs as a cost-effective way to increase employee health, productivity, problem solving, creative thinking and job satisfaction.<br></p><p>Scientific research shows that therapeutic massage relieves stress, boosts the immune system, promotes physical well-being and even improves mental outlook -- all of which can lower health care costs for companies.<br></p><p>"The strength of the enterprise nationwide and especially here in the Dallas/Fort Worth area illustrates the importance of therapeutic massage and the Massage Envy franchise model in today's economy," says Mr. O'Pry.. "We are very excited about the continued growth of the franchise -- including plans for a new center in Corinth, Texas this Spring. Accompanying our business growth is a strong demand for therapists. Massage therapy is a growing profession that offers flexibility, good pay and an opportunity to help others that many young people should consider as they think about their futures."</p><p>Entrepreneur magazine's annual rankings are based on analysis of the financial strength, size, business stability and growth of franchise companies.<br></p><p>Massage Envy is open in 42 states, with 638 centers nationwide and 27 locations in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. The company was recently named a top AllBusiness (a D&amp;B company) AllStar Franchise, and is a member of the International Franchise Association (IFA).</p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $49. Memberships are available for $59 per month and include a one-hour massage session. Members can enjoy unlimited additional one-hour massage sessions at the $39 member rate.<br></p><p><a href="http://www.massageenvy.com/locations.aspx?radius=250&amp;city=dallas&amp;" target="_blank">Massage Envy in Texas</a>&nbsp;and throughout the country has helped popularize massage.

<p>Frisco, TX -- Apr 21, 2011 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- For the fourth year in a row, the Craig Ranch, Stonebriar and Frisco North SPAMassage Envy centers are proud to sponsor Riders Against MS of Frisco, Texas in the Bike MS Sam's Club Ride on April 30 and May 1, 2011. Organized by the National MS Society Lone Star chapter, the event is a two-day fundraising bike ride from Frisco to Fort Worth. In 2010, the event raised more than $2 million to help fight multiple sclerosis. This year marks the event's 24th year in North Texas.</p><p>Multiple sclerosis (or MS) is a chronic, often disabling disease that attacks the central nervous system. The National MS Society raises money through events across the country to fund research and provide support for those affected by MS. Bike MS has come to be known as the premier cycling series in the U.S.<br></p><p>The Bike MS Sam's Club Ride kicks-off on Saturday, April 30, when more than 3,500 cyclists will depart Frisco from the Dr. Pepper Ballpark. Cyclists will ride to Texas Motor Speedway where they will stay overnight. The following morning, the cyclists will take a victory lap for MS around Texas Motor Speedway, then head to the finish line at Sundance Square in historic downtown Fort Worth to complete the 153-mile journey.<br></p><p>To show support for the Riders Against MS team, Massage Envy is providing purple cycling jerseys and on-site licensed massage therapists will be available at Texas Motor Speedway between 1:30 and 3:30 p.m. on Saturday to help riders sooth aching muscles. Each team rider will receive a certificate to redeem for a free 30-minute massage session. The massage therapists will be available for a time after 3:30 for riders who want additional massage time at $1 per minute. Massage Envy employees will also be present at the event to help cheer on the team who are easily recognizable in their purple cycling jerseys featuring the Massage Envy logo. &nbsp;<br></p><p>"Our individual riders are dedicated to raising funds and awareness to help bring an end to this disorder once and for all," says Rod Moffitt, team captain of Riders Against MS. "Massage Envy is also dedicated to helping out the cause by being a major sponsor of our cycling team. We could not do it without them."<br></p><p>The Dallas/Fort Worth Massage Envy centers not only provide beneficial services to individuals, but also support events to ensure the well-being of the community as a whole.<br></p><p>"We are proud to support the Riders Against MS in this important event and to help raise awareness of and funding for MS in our community," says Brendan McBratney, owner of Massage Envy centers in Frisco and one in McKinney. "By providing on-site therapeutic massage, we hope to enable all riders to not only complete the ride, but to feel great while doing it.

<p>Rowlett, TX -- May 03, 2011 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Having the right touch is important to a massage therapist. The same could also be said of the Rowlett Crossing Massage Envy Center in Rowlett, Texas. &nbsp;Certified massage therapist Nina Almandarez has been named Regional Therapist of the Year for 2010. She is the second consecutive staff member to be so honored -- Lead Therapist Jason Michaels was Regional Therapist of the Year for 2009.</p><p>What many of Nina's clients don't immediately realize is that she is legally blind. Nina has been with Massage Envy Rowlett for over a year, is married and has two young children. Co-owner Dr. Richard Klics notes that Nina is one of the centers "highest producing and most successful therapists."<br></p><p>"She has a great attitude, and most people do not even realize she is sight impaired unless she tells them or they get to know her a little. She is looking forward to going to Phoenix with us in May to get her award," says Dr. Klics.<br></p><p>This is the fourth year for the Regional Therapist of the Year award. Dallas/Fort Worth, with 27 centers, makes up one region. Each center employs between 25 and 45 therapists. Massage Envy Corporate selects a winner from each region. Regional winners are flown to Phoenix to receive their awards at the Gala and Awards Banquet in early May.<br></p><p>"Winning this award last year was a terrific surprise and we were so proud of Jason and our entire staff. But to win it again this year was just unbelievable! We are so happy and so proud of Nina," say co-owners Dr. Rick and April Klics.<br></p><p>Clinic Manager Morgan Tucker states that "Nobody deserves this award more than Nina. She is so sweet and compassionate to all of her clients, and such a pleasure to be around," while 2009 award recipient Jason Michaels adds, "When I asked the other therapists for suggestions on who we should nominate, it was almost unanimous, NINA!"<br></p><p>"This is such a great honor," Nina shares. "We have so many great and hard working therapists at our clinic, and I think a part of this award goes to each one of them."<br></p><p>Almandarez became a massage therapist in 2002. "I wanted to find a good career where my loss of sight would not hold me back, and where I could feel like I was making a difference.  I love doing massage and helping people, and I am glad that I work for Massage Envy.  The people here have been great and are always so positive and so helpful.  And the clients are great too.  I enjoy coming to work, and I think Massage Envy is a great career choice.  I also hope that maybe others with a disability might see me and think that maybe they can do it too!  You can't be scared or let things stop you.  You just have to reach for your dreams and believe in yourself."<br></p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $49. Memberships are available for $59 per month and include a one-hour massage session. Members can enjoy unlimited additional one-hour massage sessions at the $39 member rate.<br></p><p>Log on to <a href="http://www.massageenvy.com">www.massageenvy.com</a> to find the nearest Massage Envy center.

<p>Dallas/Fort Worth, TX -- May 19, 2011 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Stress management is essential for anyone striving to achieve a healthy lifestyle. While stress may be an accepted part of normal life, unmanaged stress can lead to health problems. Stress can weaken the immune system, cause tension headaches and increase the risk of heart disease, among other things. Stress awareness is vital to healthy living and Massage Envy Dallas/Fort Worth is here to offer some helpful tips on how to take time out from a hectic life to refresh body and mind and keep stress in check.</p><p>It is possible to reduce stress and learn to relax by using the five senses. Many holistic health practitioners agree that what people smell, taste, touch, hear and see can influence how they feel -- and maybe even bring them serenity. Try listening to soothing music during a massage or lighting a candle and taking a bath.<br></p><p>Another good way to reduce stress is to participate in an enjoyable, relaxing activity such as drawing, painting or dancing. Whether you want to draw in a sketchbook or just doodle in the margins of a newspaper, let the mind go and the imagination take over. Take a dance class in a local studio or crank up the music in your house and just dance. Studies have also suggested that viewing art, as well as creating it, can reduce stress and anxiety. Enjoy the works of art by others by visiting a museum exhibit, or just take some time to appreciate the earth's natural beauty.<br></p><p>For thousands of years, people have been meditating as a way to improve well-being. The simplest form is called concentrative meditation, which centers on slow, rhythmic breathing while the mind is cleared of all thoughts. Mindfulness meditation, on the other hand, involves focusing the mind on the thoughts and actions one is experiencing. Just be in the moment.<br></p><p>Don't worry; getting started with meditation is very simple. Just choose a quiet spot, pick a comfortable posture, focus on breathing or the repetition of a word or phrase, and be positive.<br></p><p>Last but not least, massage therapy has been proven to be one of the most effective methods for achieving stress relief. Research studies show massage therapy boosts the body's immune system, helps lower blood pressure and heart rate and relaxes muscles.<br></p><p>All types of massages help decrease stress, but the Swedish massage, reflexology and hot stone therapy are particularly good stress busters. The Swedish massage relaxes the whole body by rubbing the muscles with long, gliding strokes in the direction of the blood returning to the heart. This technique increases the level of oxygen in the blood, decreases muscle toxins and improves circulation and flexibility while easing tension in the body and decreasing one's overall stress. Reflexology massage focuses solely on the hands and feet; specific points on the extremities are targeted to send signals to the brain and balance the nervous system. Endorphins are released throughout the body, which reduces stress and returns the body to equilibrium. Hot stone therapy melts away tension and stress by placing smooth, water-heated stones at key points on the body to allow for deeper relaxation of the muscles. Hot stone therapy is becoming very popular, because it provides deeper muscle and tissue relaxation, which releases more toxins and improves circulation.<br></p><p>With the fast pace of today's world and the hectic schedules people are forced to keep, everyone can benefit from these simple and easy stress-management techniques and tools.

<p>Grand Prairie , TX -- May 26, 2011 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- The Massage Envy South 360 center located in Grand Prairie now offers relaxing, healthy facials. Like massage, facials help to combat the stressors of everyday life. These stressors can damage the appearance and health of the skin. Regular facials increase circulation, reverse visible signs of aging, improve skin tone and texture, and help to eliminate blemishes and breakouts-particularly those attributable to stress.</p><p>Massage Envy Spa's Murad Healthy Skin Facials feature specially formulated products from world-renowned Murad, Inc. The Murad skincare line is based on the fact that skin cells lose the ability to retain water as they age, so Murad products are designed to repair cell membranes while attracting water and nutrients to the cells. This unmatched approach makes Massage Envy Spa's Murad Healthy Skin Facials the most effective way to achieve balanced and more youthful-looking skin.<br></p><p>A variety of skincare treatments are offered that benefit every skin type, including:</p><ul><li>AHA Rapid Exfoliator Anti-Aging Facial that helps to reveal smoother, vibrant, younger-looking skin.</li><li>Clarifying Enzyme Acne Facial that improves skin clarity, reduces blemishes and soothes inflammation.</li><li>Environmental Shield Vitamin C Infusion Facial that reverses the signs of aging that result from everyday environmental factors such as sunlight, smog, pollution and stress.</li><li>Sensitive Skin Facial that repairs and balances the skin with a gentle, yet effective treatment designed specifically to address skin that is easily irritated or sensitive.</li></ul><p>"Massage Envy takes the same dedicated approach to skin care as it does to massage, so our customers know they are in the hands of professionals who understand their needs," says Lance O'Pry, Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Developer for Massage Envy. "And, we are happy to offer yet another service that helps our customers look and feel their best."<br></p><p>Massage Envy has very high standards for the employees performing facials. Only estheticians licensed by the state of Texas were hired and, prior to launching this new service, the center held three days of extensive training led by both a Massage Envy trainer and two Murad representatives.<br></p><p>Like massages, facials at Massage Envy are reasonably priced. The introductory price for any of the four signature facials is just $59. Clients wishing to obtain a facial service will pay only $10 more than our regular massage therapy prices.<br></p><p>Massage Envy South 360 is located at 5232 South State Highway 360, Suite 610, Grand Prairie, TX 75052.<br></p><p>At <a href="http://www.massageenvy.com/locations.aspx?radius=250&amp;city=dallas&amp;" target="_blank">Massage Envy</a>, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $49. Memberships are available for $59 per month and include a one-hour massage session.

<p>In Honor of Father's Day, Massage Envy Salutes a Father Son Duo<br></p><p>Arlington, TX -- Jun 07, 2011 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- If happy customers are a business's best advertising, then father and son duo Frank and Jordan Stockton are doing Massage Envy proud. A customer himself, Frank now owns three Massage Envy centers -- Fort Worth Hulen, Arlington Highlands and Uptown at West Village in Dallas. Son Jordan manages the Arlington Highlands center.</p><p>Frank, a former 23-year employee with Southwest Airlines, first discovered Massage Envy while doing his last-minute shopping in Coppell on Christmas Eve in 2005. Having enjoyed massages on a regular basis over the years for $90 and more, Massage Envy caught his attention with an introductory massage for $39. Although it sounded too good to be true, he bought gift cards for three friends, all of whom were "thrilled" with their experience at Massage Envy, so Frank went back to get a massage for himself.<br></p><p>The rest, as the story goes, is history. "I was shocked that my massage at Massage Envy was just as good if not better for half the price of what I usually paid! While checking out, I noticed Massage Envy was a franchise. Within seconds I knew the concept of convenient hours, affordable pricing and quality service was a terrific business model and decided to start investigating what it took to become an owner," Frank says.<br></p><p>Now that he's opened three centers where people can receive a wonderful massage experience, he most  enjoys interacting with his employees and customers. Frank tries to develop personal relationships and values input from others. After he opened the Fort Worth center, he would sit down with members to discuss their massage experience, which built great relationships with the customers, provided valuable customer service lessons and helped fine tune how he ran the business. He still holds focus groups with members to this day, which he deems "priceless."<br></p><p>Frank is most proud of his 23-year-old son Jordan, "a fine young man" who joined him in the business as a Sales Associate at the Fort Worth location in January 2007 when he was 18. Since then Jordan has worked at all three locations with his father gaining valuable leadership and customer service experience. "Jordan had to work his way up over the years" Frank says but after proving himself by handling more responsibility and being effective operationally, Jordan was promoted to supervisor, Assistant Center Manager and now Manager of the Arlington location.<br></p><p>Frank enjoys working with his son knowing they both value and model good customer service. "The customer is the reason we're here, so it's important to me, my son and my staff that each customer feels welcomed and appreciated. I treasure one-on-one time with employees and customers alike," he notes, adding, "They are what makes our Centers successful."<br></p><p>Another lesson Frank is passing along to his son to help him succeed at Massage Envy is rooted in advice he was given by his grandmother when he was first hired at Southwest Airlines. "I was eager to climb the corporate ladder so my grandmother told me that if I wanted to be successful, I should always be on time, maintain a positive attitude, don't make excuses, work hard even when the work wasn't fun, and do more than what was required of me so that I would stand out among the rest of my co-workers. I applied her advice then and still do to this day."<br></p><p>In addition to being the owner, Frank is still a Massage Envy customer. Massage therapy helps him relax, de-stress and rejuvenate, while promoting a healthy balance in his busy schedule. He also surrounds himself with enthusiastic and friendly employees including his son.<br></p><p>Father's Day is June 19. A Massage Envy gift card is the perfect gift for the special man in one's life. He deserves time to unwind from life's daily stresses with a relaxing massage at any of the Massage Envy DFW centers.<br></p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $49. Memberships are available for $59 per month and include a one-hour massage session. Members can enjoy unlimited additional one-hour massage sessions at the $39 member rate.<br></p><p>Massage Envy in Texas and throughout the country has helped popularize massage.

<p>McKinney, TX&nbsp;-- Jun 23, 2011 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Licensed Massage Therapist Joe Borchardt believes in providing celebrity treatment for each client, so it's no surprise that he has been named the new Clinic Administrator for Massage Envy Craig Ranch. The announcement was made by Brendan McBratney, owner of Massage Envy Craig Ranch, Massage Envy Stonebriar and Massage Envy Frisco North Spa, on June 20.</p><p>"Combined with his excellent skill set and expertise in customer service, dedicated service and therapeutic touch through his LMT background, his service before self specialty, and overwhelming desire to help his fellow human beings in their pursuit of health and wellness through therapeutic massage, Joe will make an excellent addition to our management team," stated McBratney.<br></p><p>Borchardt has been with Massage Envy almost five years, with more than half of that at Craig Ranch. As Clinic Administrator, he is responsible for overseeing all aspects of customer service, hiring and training. He is also attending Texas Women's University in Denton, where he expects to earn a degree in Sociology in 2012.<br></p><p>"My goal is for each person to have the $125 experience for the $59 membership, to help them improve their overall wellness and reduce stress, and to work with their wellness program," Borchardt said. He wants everyone to have the best experience possible, not just at Craig Ranch but at Massage Envy, because a person's experience reflects on Massage Envy as a whole.<br></p><p>A cancer survivor, Borchardt became a licensed massage therapist in 2006 because of his cancer experience. He wants other cancer survivors to know the benefits of massage therapy and came up with this quote.<br></p><p>"Words save us, because they empower us to feel...they empower us to think...words can hurt, or heal. Words can give hope, courage and inspire us all...But if you don't use your words...They will never be heard or known."<br></p><p>At Massage Envy Craig Ranch, Joe Borchardt will make you feel like a celebrity -- "creating a $125 experience for a $59 price every month." Pretty powerful words.<br></p><p>A one-hour introductory Massage Envy massage for non-members is only $49. Memberships are available for $59 per month and include a one-hour massage session.

<p>Massage Envy DFW recommends stretching muscles<br></p><p>DALLAS FORT WORTH, TX&nbsp;-- Aug 18, 2011 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank" title="Link: http://www.myprgenie.com/">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Even if you concentrate on conditioning, sports injuries happen. Apply ice to any strain or sprain during the first 72 hours, then switch to a moist heating pad. Nonprescription medicine can help control pain and a good sports massage can help as well.</p><p>Massage therapy is also a great help for sports injuries. Request a therapist experienced in sports massage, and ask that special attention be paid to any injured areas, says Lance O'Pry, Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Developer for Massage Envy. "A massage therapist can stretch the muscles in trouble areas, promoting increased flexibility when the body is warm and more elastic."<br></p><p>Massage therapy helps bring blood and nutrients to the affected area to repair the soft tissue. Ideally, get a massage as soon as you can tolerate it. Massage also can help break up scar tissue and keep the muscles supple so less scar tissue develops.<br></p><p>Even when there's no injury, massage also helps athletes of all levels improve their flexibility and muscle suppleness. The kneading action of a massage disperses the accumulation of lactic acid, which causes fatigued, sore muscles.<br></p><p>With today's fast-paced and hectic schedules, you can benefit from stress-management techniques and tools. Visit one of the 28 Dallas/Fort Worth Massage Envy locations to learn more about how massage therapy helps people relax and de-stress.<br></p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $49. Memberships are available for $59 per month and include a one-hour massage session. Members can enjoy unlimited additional one-hour massage sessions at the $39 member rate.<br></p><p>Massage Envy in Texas and throughout the country has helped popularize massage. Americans visit massage therapists approximately 140 million times a year. The percentage of Americans using massage therapists has more than doubled since 1997.<br></p><p>Log on to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.massageenvy.com/" target="_blank" title="Link: http://www.massageenvy.com/">www.massageenvy.com</a>&nbsp;to find the nearest Massage Envy center.

<p>GRAND PRAIRIE, TX&nbsp;-- Aug 31, 2011 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Wendy Wright is training to run a half marathon. "My son, Cohen, is the best reason for me to run and raise money for a cure for Crohn's disease," says the owner of Massage Envy Spa South 360 in Grand Prairie.</p><p>Wendy was diagnosed with Crohn's in 2002. The chronic disorder inflames the small intestine or colon. The inflammation leads to ulcerations and bowel injury. Symptoms include fatigue, abdominal pain, fever and weight loss.<br></p><p>As many as one in four Crohn's patients have a close relative with the disease, so Wendy knows there's a chance that her son Cohen will be affected. Crohn's most often strikes adolescents and young adults but can also affect young children. Some 10 percent of Crohn's patients are under age 18.<br></p><p>"So far I have been lucky and have only had mild symptoms from this very debilitating disease," Wendy said. "When I heard about the Team Challenge run, I jumped at the chance to join this cause." She will run her half-marathon December 4 in Las Vegas.<br></p><p>Several of Wendy's coworkers have contributed to her Team Challenge efforts. The center is located at 5232 South State Highway 360, Suite 610, Grand Prairie, TX 75052, phone 817-303-ENVY (3689).<br></p><p>"By supporting Team Challenge, you are also supporting me and the 1.4 million people who suffer from Crohn's disease and inflammatory colitis," Wendy said. "I want to thank my many friends and family members who are contributing to this cause which is so personal to me. Your support is really appreciated."<br></p><p>Wendy is already more than halfway to her $3,300 goal.

<p>ROCKWALL, TX&nbsp;-- Sep 02, 2011 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- The time seems right to Kenneth Lyons, co-owner with wife Celeste of Massage Envy Rockwall Clinic. On September 1, the clinic became Massage Envy Spa Rockwall and is now offering customized facials using Murad(R) Skincare Products.</p><p>Just as massage can help deal with life's everyday stresses, so can facials. The appearance and health of our skin are affected by products applied to the face, poor diet, illness and pollution. Regular facials increase circulation, reverse visible signs of aging, improve skin tone and texture, and help to eliminate blemishes and breakouts -- particularly those attributable to stress.<br></p><p>At the yearly Massage Envy conference held this past spring, Lyons saw how well the spas worked and wanted to offer the service to his clients. "We are really excited about our new spa services and think the training will fuel the fire," he stated, adding "our clients are really excited about adding facials to their visits, too."<br></p><p>Massage Envy Spa's Murad Healthy Skin Facials feature specially formulated products from world-renowned Murad, Inc. The Murad skincare line is based on the fact that that skin cells lose the ability to retain water as they age, so Murad products are designed to repair cell membranes while attracting water and nutrients to the cells. This unmatched approach makes Massage Envy Spa's Murad Healthy Skin Facials the most effective way to achieve balanced and more youthful-looking skin.<br></p><p>A variety of skincare treatments are offered that benefit every skin type, including:</p><ul><li>AHA Rapid Exfoliator Anti-Aging Facial that helps to reveal smoother, vibrant, younger-looking skin.</li><li>Clarifying Enzyme Acne Facial that improves skin clarity, reduces blemishes and soothes inflammation.</li><li>Environmental Shield Vitamin C Infusion Facial that reverses the signs of aging that result from everyday environmental factors such as sunlight, smog, pollution and stress.</li><li>Sensitive Skin Facial that repairs and balances the skin with a gentle, yet effective treatment designed specifically to address skin that is easily irritated or sensitive.</li></ul><p>"Massage Envy takes the same dedicated approach to skin care as it does to massage, so our guests know they are in the hands of professionals who understand their needs," says Lance O'Pry, Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Developer for Massage Envy. "And, we are happy to offer yet another service that helps our customers' look and feel their best."<br></p><p>Massage Envy has very high standards for the employees performing facials. Only estheticians licensed by the state of Texas have been hired and will undergo extensive training led by both a Massage Envy trainer and two Murad representatives prior to September 1.<br></p><p>Like massages, facials at Massage Envy are reasonably priced. The introductory price for any of the four signature facials is just $59. Clients wishing to obtain a facial service will pay only $10 more than the regular Massage Envy massage therapy prices.<br></p><p>Massage Envy Spa Rockwall is located at 2931 Ridge Road, Suite 111, Rockwall, TX 75032 and is the seventh Massage Envy Spa in Dallas/Fort Worth.<br></p><p>With today's fast pace and hectic schedules, everyone can benefit from therapeutic massage.

<p>Massage Envy's Healing Hands Day -- October 12<br></p><p>MCKINNEY, TX&nbsp;-- Sep 16, 2011 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- The word is out about Massage Envy Eldorado Parkway in McKinney. Among the clinic's members are several who receive massage therapy to cope with arthritis pain. Two share how regular massage allows them to go about their lives and are happy to have a location so close to them.</p><p>For Denise Laman, arthritis is a family affair. Both of her parents have arthritis, as did all of her grandparents. She was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis over 30 years ago, which affects most of her body, and now her son has arthritis. In recent years, Denise was also found to have psoriatic arthritis in her feet. "My elbows are about the only part of me that isn't affected," she laughs.<br></p><p>Arthritis leaves Denise with a burning sensation. She goes to Massage Envy about twice a month for what she calls pain management. After a session, the burning has eased to more of a tingle, "as if something is being released," Denise says. While she has to take arthritis and anti-inflammatory medication, massage therapy allows her to stay off pain medicine.<br></p><p>Massage therapy "is a godsend," states Denise, adding that her massage therapist at Massage Envy, Jane, is "awesome." Denise has used massage for a long time to deal with the affects of arthritis and credits her brother, a massage therapist and acupuncturist, for recommending massage therapy. Without massage, "I couldn't function without more medication -- I only take two now. I probably wouldn't even by walking."<br></p><p>"It's a lifestyle issue," states Pam Knies, referring to managing her arthritis. Simple, everyday activities aggravate and cause pain. "Driving is the worst, but even pulling weeds is a problem," she says.<br></p><p>Pam was diagnosed with arthritis about 1½ years ago but has had pain for about 10 years. She has been going to Massage Envy for massage therapy 1 to 2 times a week for the last year. "I have a really bad back, and massage keeps me from taking medication." Eventually she will need to have surgery, but massage allows her to manage the pain until then.<br></p><p>She understands that not everyone likes to be touched. But, "I tell everyone I know how good massage makes me feel," says Pam. "It's affordable, and anyone who has known me awhile can see the difference."<br></p><p>On World Arthritis Day, October 12, 2011, Massage Envy is partnering with the Arthritis Foundation to host Healing Hands for Arthritis, a one-day national Massage Envy event to build awareness and raise funds to fight arthritis. Massage Envy will donate $10 from every one-hour massage and facial on October 12 to the Arthritis Foundation. To make an appointment for the Healing Hands for Arthritis event, contact Massage Envy. To book your appointment for Healing Hands Day at one of the 28 Dallas/Fort Worth locations call 214-556-2475.<br></p><p>Massage Envy Eldorado Parkway is located at 2890 Craig Drive, Suite 120, in McKinney. Call 214-544-ENVY (3689) for an appointment.<br></p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $49. Memberships are available for $59 per month and include a one-hour massage session. Members can enjoy unlimited additional one-hour massage sessions at the $39 member rate.<br></p><p>Massage Envy in Texas and throughout the country has helped popularize massage. Americans visit massage therapists approximately 140 million times a year. The percentage of Americans using massage therapists has more than doubled since 1997.<br></p><p>Log on to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.massageenvy.com/" target="_blank">www.massageenvy.com</a>&nbsp;to find the nearest Massage Envy clinic.

<p>Local Community Showed Widespread Support of Event Benefiting the Arthritis Foundation<br></p><p>Dallas Fort Worth, Texas -- Nov 04, 2011 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank" title="Link: http://www.myprgenie.com/">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Massage Envy, the pioneer and national leader of professional, affordable and convenient massage and spa services, and the Dallas/Fort Worth community came together on World Arthritis Day, October 12, to raise $16,725 during their Healing Hands for Arthritis event benefiting the Arthritis Foundation's mission to prevent, control and cure arthritis. Massage Envy DFW, and more than 700 other Massage Envy clinics around the country, donated $10 from every one-hour massage and facial to the Arthritis Foundation and collectively raised nearly $500,000 across the nation.</p><p>"We were overwhelmed by the community's strong support for Healing Hands for Arthritis," said Lance O'Pry, DFW Regional Developer for Massage Envy. "The event was truly a team effort, and we are very thankful for our wonderful members and guests, as well as our therapists, estheticians and clinic staff, who helped make it a huge success."<br></p><p>During Healing Hands for Arthritis, Murad(R), Massage Envy Spa's exclusive skin care partner, also donated 10 percent of sales from their products sold at Massage Envy Spa locations to the Arthritis Foundation.<br></p><p>Today, arthritis strikes 50 million adults and 300,000 children and is the leading cause of disability in the nation. Massage Envy partnered with the Arthritis Foundation to help conquer this painful and debilitating disease. In addition to hosting Healing Hands for Arthritis, Massage Envy is a national sponsor of the Arthritis Foundation's 200 Arthritis Walk(R) events, where local Massage Envy owners from across the country have shared information about the benefits of massage therapy, provided chair massages and supported the Arthritis Foundation's mission at their respective local walks.<br></p><p>With consumers visiting massage therapists at least 150 million times a year, it is evident that more Americans are turning to therapeutic massage to relieve the painful symptoms of arthritis and fibromyalgia, while improving circulation, joint flexibility, sleep patterns and an overall sense of well-being.<br></p><p>Over the past two years, Massage Envy has donated nearly $100,000 to fund clinical research related to the benefits of massage therapy. Recent scientific studies have found that massage therapy increases immune function, decreases stress levels and reduces recovery time in many medical conditions including arthritis.<br></p><p>The experienced, professional therapists at Massage Envy DFW clinics can design effective and customized massage treatments to address the individual needs of any member or guest. For more information, contact one of the 28 Dallas/Fort Worth Massage Envy locations.<br></p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $49.

Bottom line: Alibaba-affiliated Ant Financial is experiencing breakneck growth through its roll-out of a wide array of new products and services, and could be valued at up to $150 billion by the time it makes its IPO as soon as next year.<br><br>A new report is spotlighting the rapid rise of Ant Financial, the financial services affiliate of e-commerce giant Alibaba that looks set to challenge not only domestic rival UnionPay but also upcoming drives into China by global giants Visa and MasterCard. Much of Ants incredibly rapid rise is tied to its core Alipay asset, which began life as an electronic payments service but is rapidly moving into other areas like credit card-style offline payments and savings account services.<br><br>The latest reports also contain a new figure on Ants valuation following its first major capital raising. That figure of $45 billion is substantially larger than an earlier figure of $30 billion that was contained in initial reports on the funding just a week ago. (previous post) But those earlier reports also pointed out the low valuation was based on shares that were probably sold at a discount to a big domestic institutional investor, perhaps for strategic reasons, and that the real value could be as high as $50 billion.<br><br>The latest reports show just why Ant is getting such rich valuations, as it tries to become Chinas first privately owned giant specializing in a wide array of financial services. The reports say that Ant has been quietly mounting a campaign to get Alipay accepted in traditional brick-and-mortar stores that now mostly accept only UnionPay, Chinas homegrown transaction settlement network operator that is a joint venture of the nations major banks.<br><br>According to the reports, more than 130,000 Chinese offline stores now accept payment by Alipay, and another 900,000 taxi cabs can also accept payment via the service.&nbsp;One of Alipays biggest new clients is Yum Brands&nbsp; KFC chain, which recently began accepting Alipay and is planning to quickly expand the program into all of its 4,500 stores in China. (previous post) Since then Ive seen similar reports saying Alipay is also moving into KFCs fast-food rival McDonalds.<br><br>The taxi initiative looks different from anything Ive seen to date, and shows why Ant is quickly gaining ground on the stodgier and more conservative UnionPay. Most taxis in China dont accept any payment besides cash, though my adopted hometown of Shanghai has for years allowed payment using city-backed subway cards. UnionPay could have easily tried to tap this market at any time, but instead has focused on building up a retail-based network similar to those operated by MasterCard and Visa.<br><br>Meantime, the real MasterCard and Visa are probably looking increasingly at Alipay and Ant as their top competitor for the day when they can finally enter the China market for domestic yuan-denominated transactions. The pair recently won permission to enter China after filing a complaint at the WTO. But even so, they will have to wait until 2018 to offer such yuan-denominated services due to a Chinese law that prohibits companies from offering such services for the first 3 years after they enter the market. By that time, Alipay could easily overtake UnionPay and become the main rival for the 2 western giants.<br><br>As to Ants valuation, the latest $45-$50 billion figure is roughly in line with reports from earlier this year when word of the funding first splashed into the headlines. Ant has said its not in any hurry to make an IPO, even though reports last week indicated the company was being pressured to list on a new strategic industries board that could launch in Shanghai as soon as next year. (previous post)<br><br>I was always a bit skeptical about valuations for Alibaba during the companys meteoric rise, even though I was often wrong. I still question the big figures, but clearly others think the company is quite valuable due to its vision and aggressive practices. Investors are now applying similar thinking to Ant, and I wouldnt be surprised to see the companys value easily double and possibly triple by the time it makes its highly anticipated domestic IPO as early as next year or in 2017.<br><br>Doug Young is a former China company news chief for Reuters who teaches financial journalism at Fudan University in Shanghai.

<p><a href="http://www.italki.com/article/414/the-language-toolbox-for-any-language-learner" target="_blank" title="Link: http://www.italki.com/article/414/the-language-toolbox-for-any-language-learner">http://www.italki.com/article/414/the-language-toolbox-for-any-language-learner</a> <br></p>
<p>Today Im ready to share one of my favourite discoveries of this year for learning a language; <a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/italki" target="_blank">italki.</a></p><p>Ive reviewed several websites in the past, such as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/lingq-review/" target="_blank">LingQ</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/busuu-livemocha-review/" target="_blank">Livemocha &amp; Busuu</a>,<a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/duolingo/" target="_blank">DuoLingo</a>, and paid courses such as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/rosetta-stone-review/" target="_blank">Rosetta Stone</a>. They each have advantages and disadvantages, but my conclusion is generally the same, that you cant beat the best language learning system in the world;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/hb/" target="_blank">HB 2.0</a>. (Spoiler alert, HB stands for&nbsp;Human Beings)</p><p>And thats the reason why I like italki so much. There are no courses or gimmicks to distract you, it focuses&nbsp;entirely&nbsp;on connecting you to Human Beings.</p><p>If you live in an international city, there are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/social-search" target="_blank">some social networks</a>&nbsp;like Couchsurfing and meetup.com can be great sites to check out to try and meet up with people in person, but if you&nbsp;cant&nbsp;find those people, then of course thanks to the wonders of the Internet, you can simply&nbsp;Skype&nbsp;a native speaker and speak to them to practice your language from the comfort of your home.</p><p>As Im trying to demonstrate with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/arabic-mission/" target="_blank">my current project</a>, you can actually learn to speak a language very well by doing it&nbsp;entirely&nbsp;via Skype. Once you find those people to practise with and learn from via Skype, then you have no excuse to not make progress as quickly as possible, which your speed depending on how many spoken sessions you get and how intensively you are learning.</p><p></p><h2>WIDE RANGE OF LANGUAGES AVAILABLE</h2><p>I started using this site back in February with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/chinese/" target="_blank">Chinese</a>, and I found it worked out cheaper than getting in-person lessons, even though I was in the country with plenty of teachers available around me. The selection was actually&nbsp;better&nbsp;on this site for Mandarin teachers than what I could find on online advertisement boards or in newspapers in Taipei itself!</p><p>As well as this, it was way more convenient to do it from home, than travel across town for the more affordable lessons, so I actually moved&nbsp;all&nbsp;my lessons to be entirely Skype based.</p><p>And over the summer, I wanted to work on improving&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/polyglot-summer/" target="_blank">every single one of my languages</a>. So I actually got Skype lessons to help me improve my Spanish, French, German and Italian (analyzing cultural subtleties, such as complex lines in a movie, or improving my accent, as these are my best languages  as well as fixing a few annoying mistakes that were slipping into my dialogues). (I used another resource for Dutch, and didnt bother working on my Portuguese since I knew Id be spending three months in Brazil)</p><p>I continued to use it to help me maintain my Chinese, and&nbsp;even&nbsp;get back into my American Sign Language to prepare for my visit to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/gallaudet" target="_blank">Gallaudet university</a>. Yes  you can learn sign language via Skype of course. It was great to be getting back into ASL despite being in Hong Kong of all places! I found my ASL teacher on this site.</p><p>And finally, now Im learning Arabic, and once again the vast majority of my lessons are with teachers Ive found via&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/italki" target="_blank">italki</a>. There were a large enough pool of teachers to choose from that I could even focus specifically just on teachers from Egypt, as that dialect is my priority.</p><p>Youll find that all the major languages are covered with a lot of teachers and exchange partners to choose between, and some minor ones have a couple of teachers  this is only going to improve with time as the site is growing very quickly.</p><h2>THREE OPTIONS: LESSONS FROM PROFESSIONAL TEACHERS, PRACTICE WITH ENTHUSIASTS AND FREE LANGUAGE EXCHANGE</h2><p>I have personally used the site exclusively for&nbsp;paid&nbsp;lessons, although I havent even paid that much (see below). Having said that, it can also work for those looking not to spend any money at all.</p><p>You have three options to choose from when searching for someone to help you with your target language:</p><p><a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/italki"><img width="440" alt="" src="http://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/lessons.jpg" height="39" title="lessons"></a></p><ul><li>Language Lessons</li></ul><p>The language lessons option is given only by&nbsp;professional teachers. So this would be those who have experience teaching offline/in the real world, with certification as language professionals (uploaded to the site for verification).</p><p>This option tends to be more expensive, but you can be more confident that youd get a high quality lesson, as the teacher is expected to guide the lesson more and adapt to your needs better, based on their experience. This obviously varies with the person you have the lesson with.</p><ul><li>Speaking Practice</li></ul><p>This option is given by a native speaker (if you select it) who is eager to help others by teaching the language. They may not have any experience teaching off Skype, and would have a day-job unrelated to teaching.</p><p>It can be tricky to get a lesson with a less experienced teacher when you are starting off yourself. These lessons are more appropriate when you are truly interested in practising, with someone who will patiently listen and correct your mistakes. This option is usually more affordable than the language lessons option, specifically because its less likely to follow a lesson format.</p><p>In my case, this option is quite fine. Ive got teaching experience so I can decide to take the role of deciding where the lesson goes. This is a LOT of work when Im also a beginner in the language however, and its difficult when the teacher keeps asking So, what do you want to talk about now? with my current very limited vocabulary.</p><p>The thing is, sometimes even when someone doesnt have a certificate, or experience in a classroom, they can be an&nbsp;excellent&nbsp;teacher. Ive found people at this level that are honestly way better teachers than those with diplomas, who can also take the lesson in a direction that works well for the student, while some professional teachers have a fixed programme that they stick very rigidly too, which may not work well for a particular student.</p><p>The ideal thing is to try out several teachers (see Trial explanation below) from both categories and go with the one(s) you feel is helping you the most.</p><ul><li>Language Exchange</li></ul><p>This option is great if you cant afford to be getting private lessons, but still want time with a native who is motivated to patiently listen to you and correct your mistakes. All you have to do in exchange is to teach them&nbsp;your&nbsp;native language!</p><p>And yes, the demand for English teachers is&nbsp;huge&nbsp; especially if you speak a dialect they happen to be interested in.</p><p>In this sense, the large pool of people and the ability to search means youll find quite a lot of people here! Since the conversation is ultimately over Skype, and the site just acts as a way to find these people, you could also search in other sites like<a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/busuu-livemocha-review/" target="_blank">Livemocha/Busuu</a>&nbsp;and message them to connect to Skype. The forum on this blog also has an active&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/forum/find-a-conversation-exchange/" target="_blank">language exchange board</a>&nbsp;where people announce the language combination.</p><p>Since its free, Id recommend trying italki out with the other options until you find the person or people you find is/are definitely helping YOU out. If you end up speaking just in English (presuming thats your native language), then you should consider finding someone else. The search facility makes italki that extra bit easier to use.</p><h2>MANY TRIAL LESSONS FOR $1-5? IDEAL FOR FINDING THE BEST TEACHER FOR YOU</h2><p>There are loads of other sites that let you search for paid teachers. Ive tried a bunch out (Ill actually share all of the ones I used for Chinese in a separate post, since I didnt exclusively use italki; although if you have Arabic alternatives for me, let me know so I can perhaps review that later too), and generally I just find italkis interface so much cleaner and easier to navigate.</p><p>But one thing that makes it stand out is that (if the teacher has enabled that option) you can get a&nbsp;trial lesson&nbsp;with&nbsp;each&nbsp;teacher for a much better rate than their normal class rate.</p><p>This allows you to actually go through a&nbsp;bunch&nbsp;of trial lessons at first and find which teacher works in a way that is going to help your needs best. Whenever I started to use teachers for any of the languages of this year, I went through trials of as many as I could find, and had full-price lessons only with the&nbsp;good&nbsp;ones.</p><p>For me for example, if the teacher is doing most of the talking and teaching at me, with a pre-made course that I just have to basically keep grunting to show them Im still online, then I consider it wasting my time, as I can get this information from a book or Youtube just as easily without paying by the hour. Then again you might prefer the traditional course approach and dislike teachers that Id enjoy classes with.</p><p>It was great to be able to try out dozens of teachers, but not actually end up spending so much money. (Of course, you only get one trial maximum per teacher) A few people have been asking me to recommend specific teachers, and I really think trying several of them out for yourself is by far the best option, as the cheaper trial option really wont break the bank.</p><p><a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/italki"><img width="346" alt="" src="http://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/trial.jpg" height="120" title="trial"></a></p><p>The actual price of the trial and the main lesson depends on a lot of factors, including:</p><ul><li>Does the teacher have enough reviews to be able to raise their rates yet (he/she may be a new teacher, but still really good, and as such has cheap trial rates to encourage more people to try out a lesson),</li><li>What country are they from (my teachers in China were cheap for&nbsp;both&nbsp;trialsand main lessons; the main lessons with some of my teachers were as low as US$5!! And these are good teachers! They just happen to live deep inside China where living expenses are much lower. But currency differences means that teachers in Europe, North America, Japan etc. tend to be more expensive)</li><li>The teachers experience overall and possible lesson quality</li></ul><h2>INTERESTING REFERRAL SYSTEM FOR SAVING MONEY</h2><p>Now, Ive been getting two spoken lessons/practice sessions in Arabic&nbsp;a day&nbsp;since my project started almost a month ago.&nbsp;<a href="http://speakfromday1.com/" rel="external nofollow">Speaking from day 1</a>&nbsp;is my mantra, and its the only way a&nbsp;fluent in 3 months&nbsp;goal is feasible, so you can bet I encourage you to also speak as much as often, as early as possible.</p><p>Those in Egypt are charging about US$8-15 per hour long lesson. So with a bit of mathematics, you may guess that Im spending about US$600 a month on private lessons (which would already be better than most generic courses where you are sitting in a class being talked at, especially considering you are getting one-on-one attention).</p><p>In fact, Ive spent much less. You see, italki have an interesting referral system  so if you click&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/italki" target="_blank">this link</a>&nbsp;to their site, youll connect to&nbsp;my profile&nbsp;on the site and see some details of how my learning is going (although Ive enabled privacy settings in some cases). By signing up on this referral link, if you decided to go for paid lessons then Id earn credit for this, and ultimately it costs the exact same for you.</p><p>At the moment, the referral gives you US$20 credit to be used on the site, for every $40 spent by those you have personally referred.</p><p>Ive dropped the italki link to my profile inside of a blog post or two this year, and promoted it actively in the Language Hacking League email once. The resulting sign-ups have given me free credit, which Ive been using for my lessons. So by writing this blog post and sharing a resource I genuinely find useful, Im also ultimately getting more free lessons  cool huh?</p><p>This means that after you get into it, if you decide to tell others about it, use&nbsp;yourreferral link (on Facebook, or on your blogs sidebar if you have one etc., or even in an email) and youll get enough for&nbsp;several&nbsp;lessons if that person decides to pay for some lessons. [If you dont want to sign up&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/italki" target="_blank">on my referral link</a>&nbsp;(since Im using it in this blog post), just type italki.com into your browser, although the result is the same, whether you buy lessons or go just for the free exchanges]</p><p>I have also spent my own money though. Another advantage of this system is that it lets you pay by&nbsp;credit card, paypal, Moneybookers bank transfer, Skrill, China Union pay, Allpay, cashu,&nbsp;and&nbsp;webmoney. In my case, paypal is really convenient as I prefer to avoid paying a lot on credit, as doing so had me in debt&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/hitting-a-brick-wall-in-your-language-progress/" target="_blank">a few years ago</a>.</p><h2>EARN MONEY AS A TEACHER</h2><p>As well as using the system to learn a language, you can also earn money through it by applying to be a teacher. You should consider this both if you are a qualified professional&nbsp;and&nbsp;if you are simply enthusiastic to teach your native (or high level fluent) language to others, while earning from it.</p><p>The system takes a 15% commission from your classes (which is way less than what a school like Berlitz used to take from student payments to teacher earnings when I used to work for them&nbsp;<img alt="" src="http://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f61b.png">&nbsp;), and since its a large network you are much more likely to find students than you would by trying to advertise independently in many cases.</p><h2>EASY TO USE INTERNATIONAL TIME MANAGER</h2><p><a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/italki"><img width="498" alt="" src="http://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/calendar.jpg" height="233" title="calendar"></a></p><p>While testing out a&nbsp;LOT&nbsp;of alternative sites for finding private language lessons (especially for Chinese), one major headache was trying to synchronise times with the teachers. When we were in the same country, it was a non-issue, but otherwise I had to use online time conversions to figure things out.</p><p>One site I found sticks to only using GMT, which drove me crazy because during the summer (because of daylight savings), this time only applies to Iceland!! Since I was checking London time (even though I wasnt even in that time zone), I wasted an hour waiting for my teachers on that other site.</p><p>italki simply shows you a calendar for whatever you have set your time-zone to. Its all you have to concern yourself with  but it shows you availabilities that your teachers have that&nbsp;they&nbsp;have selected, based on their own timezone. This synchs up nicely and there is no confusion about it, and you see all times from your perspective.</p><p>As well as this, the system will email you two hours before your class starts, to remind you, which is great if you arent super organized.</p><h2>PROBLEMS WITH THE SYSTEM?</h2><p>italki is a recent start up that is growing very quickly. As such they are very receptive to feedback. In fact, I had the chance to meet up with Kevin Chang, the CEO, briefly when I was passing through Shanghai (where the company is based).</p><p>I held out on writing this review because I did indeed have several frustrating issues with the system, and wasnt shy to vent these to Kevin throughout the year. He was very receptive in fixing problems with the referral system and annoying issues I had with privacy on the site, as well as a few other minor issues.</p><p>Luckily these problems have been removed, so I have much less negative things to say about the system, and its why Im so eager to recommend it!</p><p>One recent feedback I gave Kevin though, which Id like to see is&nbsp;a personal note&nbsp;to leave on teacher pages. After a lesson, you can write a review of a teacher for everyone to see, and this will help others decide if they should have a lesson with the teacher. But sometimes Id like to write my own note that other people dont need to see.</p><p>Maybe the teacher was excellent, but doesnt work with my own approach or personality. In one of the systems I used for Chinese there was a non-published note only you could see, and this helped me keep track of what I personally saw as teachers strengths and who I probably shouldnt have lessons with again, without punishing them with a public bad review. Having said that, seeing public reviews of teachers is a great way to vent out the bad ones, and make sure you dont waste time to begin with.</p><p>Another thing is that Id like to have an option to synch my italki calendar with my Google Calendar automatically, since Id generally manually add lessons into my calendar each time.</p><p>Other than these two minor points that dont affect the overall experience much, all other frustrations Ive had with the system this year have actually been removed, so I cant quite nitpick much further!</p><h2>OVERALL, DEFINITELY WORTH CHECKING OUT!</h2><p>There are other features of the site, such as the ability to add public notes in your target language, that are like status updates, but that natives can comment on to correct you. Its great to be able to ask a question about a grammatical feature, or quick translation question, of the language and have the community answer it for you for free.</p><p>There is also a chat feature that you can use with someone before youd leave the site to call via Skype. Im sure the site will continue to improve and expand with time.</p><p>Of course, the quality you get out of it, depends on how much work you put into it. At the end of the day, it will be you and another person on Skype and youll have to work hard to make sure you progress in your target language, and work well with them. In many cases, its as much the students fault as it is the teachers if progress is slow.</p><p>Ill write another post later about how Id recommend working with teachers efficiently to learn as well as possible, and get as much value out of that time as possible.</p><p>The system follows my own philosophy, by focusing on human connections andspeaking&nbsp;languages as the focus, and as such I do recommend&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/italki" target="_blank">you give it a try</a>.</p><div><br></div>

To complete the challenge a learner will have to complete 12 hours of lessons with a <a href="http://www.italki.com/teacher/professional/">professional teacher or community tutor</a> on italki between June 1st and June 30th. Participants who complete the challenge will be rewarded with italki credits and gifts. Registration for the June 2015 challenge is now open at <a href="http://www.italki.com/languagechallenge">www.italki.com/languagechallenge</a>. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>"The Language Challenge is a great way to get motivated and to make real progress on learning a foreign language. I have friends that want to improve their Chinese, but they often make excuses saying, 'Why now?' The Language Challenge is a reason to start now." said Kevin Chen, co-founder at italki.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>A well-known polyglot at <a href="http://www.lindsaydoeslanguages.com/">Lindsay Does Languages</a>, Lindsay Dow, found that the Language Challenge helped her reach her personal learning goals:</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Having a variety of lessons motivated me to keep going and even on the days when I didnt feel up to it, or didnt feel that I had the time, knowing that the lesson was booked and I was going to be paying if I liked it or not meant I couldnt slack off! No procrastination on Facebook, no 5 more minutes YouTube and no excuses. And every time I felt a sense of achievement. said Dow.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>How it works: </p><p>Participants pay an entry fee of $10 to join the Language Challenge. &nbsp;If the challenger completes 12 hours of lessons with an italki teacher within the month of June, they will receive a reward of $40 in italki credits. italki credits are used for 1-on-1 online classes with professional native-speaker teachers. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Challenge History: </p><p>The original concept behind the Language Challenge was based on two key ideas: a city marathon, and a smart incentivization scheme. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Similar to a city marathon, the Language Challenge brings language learners to socially "train" together to achieve a defined goal. The social element turns the challenge into a public event, and helps the participants encourage each other to complete the challenge.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>"Having a defined goal, such as taking 12 lessons, is crucial for focus. In language learning, it's not easy to set a goal because progress is not easy to quantify, and there is always more room to improve." said Kevin Chen, co-founder of italki</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>The other idea was to offer a reward to people who achieve their goals, and to have the reward funded by the people who fail to achieve them. This concept was inspired by experimental gyms that were testing new payment models, such as charging higher membership fees for people who failed to go to the gym regularly.¹</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>The first Language Challenge was held in 2012, and the June 2015 challenge is the 10th in the series. The number of challengers has increased in almost every challenge, and over a thousand challengers are expected to participate in June. The Language Challenge attracts learners from all around the world, and many celebrity polyglots and language enthusiasts have participated in previous challenges. </p><p><b><br><br></b></p><p>For more information about the June 2015 Language Challenge, please follow this link:</p><p><a href="http://www.italki.com/languagechallenge">www.italki.com/languagechallenge</a></p><p><b><br></b></p><p>For stories from previous Language Challenge participants, please follow this link:</p><p><a href="http://stories.italki.com/story/category/language-challenge">http://stories.italki.com/story/category/language-challenge</a></p><p><b><br><br></b></p><p>italki Company Introduction</p><p>italki.com is a community marketplace that connects language learners with teachers around the world.

<p>Almost 200 toys collected in Toys for Tots campaign<br></p><p>DALLAS/FORT WORTH, TX&nbsp;-- Jan 13, 2012 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Alisyn Schreiber and her co-workers at Massage Envy Rowlett know that Christmas is all about gifts given, not gifts received. The resultalmost 200 toys for area children.</p><p>Partnering with Toys for Tots, the annual Marine Corps campaign for needy children, the staff at the Rowlett Massage Envy clinic collected toys for more than four weeks before Christmas.<br></p><p>"We believe that every child should be able to open a present on Christmas morning," Ms. Schreiber said. "And every family should be able to celebrate the holiday season without stress or worry."<br></p><p>Spearheaded by Ms. Schreiber, the clinic offered incentives to both clients and the staff to donate toys. Toys for Tots signs and a donation box were prominently displayed at the clinic during November and December.<br></p><p>"We chose to work with Toys for Tots this Christmas because we care about bringing joy and happiness to those who aren't as fortunate as others," Ms. Schreiber said. "Many of us are parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, and we wanted to be able to reach out to families in the DFW area. Next year, we want to shoot for 300 toys."<br></p><p>"We're so happy and proud of our staff," said Dr. Rick Klics and his wife, April, owners of Massage Envy Rowlett. "This was their idea, and they did all of the work to make this so successful. It really feels good to give back to our community." &nbsp;<br></p><p>Several Massage Envy clinics in the D/FW area joined with the U.S. Marine Corps and its Toys for Tots program.<br></p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $49.

<p>Customized Facials Will Use Murad Skincare Products<br></p><p>Dallas Fort Worth, Texas -- Feb 01, 2012 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- As of January 23, Massage Envy Rowlett clinic will be Massage Envy Spa Rowlett. The Spa now offers customized facials using Murad(R) Skincare Products, says Dr. Richard Klics, owner of Massage Envy Spa Rowlett.</p><p>Just as massage can help deal with everyday stresses, so can facials. Your skin's appearance and health can suffer from products applied to the face, poor diet, illness and pollution. Regular facials increase circulation, reverse visible signs of aging, improve skin tone and texture, and help eliminate blemishes and breakouts -- particularly those caused by stress.<br></p><p>At last year's Massage Envy conference, Dr. Klics saw how well other spas worked and wanted to offer the service to his clients. "Our new spa services offer a new relaxing dimension for our clients," said Dr. Klics. "Our guests are really excited about adding facials to their visits."<br></p><p>Massage Envy Spa's Murad Healthy Skin Facials feature specially formulated products from world-renowned Murad, Inc. Because skin cells lose the ability to retain water as they age, Murad products are specially formulated to repair cell membranes while attracting water and nutrients to the cells. This unmatched approach makes Massage Envy Spa's Murad Healthy Skin Facials the most effective way to achieve balanced and more youthful-looking skin.<br></p><p>Massage Envy Spa Rowlett offers a variety of skincare treatments that benefit every skin type, including:<br></p><p> AHA Rapid Exfoliator Anti-Aging Facial helps reveal smoother, vibrant, younger-looking skin.<br> Clarifying Enzyme Acne Facial improves skin clarity, reduces blemishes and soothes inflammation.<br> Environmental Shield Vitamin C Infusion Facial reverses signs of aging caused by environmental factors such as sunlight, smog, pollution and stress.<br> Sensitive Skin Facial repairs and balances the skin with a gentle, yet effective treatment designed specifically to address skin that is easily irritated or sensitive.</p><p>"Massage Envy takes the same dedicated approach to skin care as it does to massage, so our guests know they are in the hands of professionals who understand their needs," says Lance O'Pry, Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Developer for Massage Envy. "And, we are happy to offer yet another service that helps our customers' look and feel their best."<br></p><p>Because of Massage Envy's high standards for employees performing facials, only estheticians licensed by the state of Texas were hired for the Rowlett spa. They underwent extensive training, led by both a Massage Envy trainer and two Murad representatives, before January 23.<br></p><p>Like massages, facials at Massage Envy are reasonably priced. The introductory price for any of the four signature facials is just $59. Clients can have a facial for only $10 more than the regular Massage Envy massage therapy price.<br></p><p>Massage Envy Spa Rowlett is located at 4301 Lakeview Parkway, Suite 600, Rowlett, and is the eighth Massage Envy Spa in Dallas/Fort Worth.<br></p><p>With today's fast pace and hectic schedules, everyone can benefit from facials and therapeutic massage. Visit one of the 28 Dallas/Fort Worth Massage Envy clinics to learn more about how massage therapy helps people relax and de-stress.<br></p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $49. Memberships are available for $59 per month and include a one-hour massage session. Members can enjoy unlimited additional one-hour massage sessions at the $39 member rate.<br></p><p>Massage Envy in Texas and throughout the country has helped popularize massage.

<p>National Sleep Awareness Week is March 7-13, 2012<br></p><p>Dallas Fort Worth, TX&nbsp;-- Feb 15, 2012 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- If you've ever had a thorough massage, you know how relaxing it can be. So it's no surprise that massage can help when you're having trouble sleeping, notes Massage Envy.</p><p>The benefits of massage are many -- loosen or soothe sore, aching muscles; reduce stress; improve circulation; release tension; lower heart rate and blood pressure; and help strengthen the immune system. These relaxing effects make massage a big help in restoring restful sleep.<br></p><p>Massage can also help treat sleeping problems due to stress, migraine headache, pain, and muscle and joint stiffness. National Sleep Awareness Week, March 7-13, is the perfect time to improve your sleep.<br></p><p>The leading massage provider in the U.S., Massage Envy "believes that everybody deserves a good night's sleep," said Lance O'Pry, Dallas/Fort Worth regional developer for Massage Envy. "That's why we offer affordable massage therapy sessions with flexible appointment times seven days a week to fit even the busiest schedules. And, with 28 locations in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, massage has never been more convenient."<br></p><p>Therapeutic massage relieves stress by easing muscle tightness and increasing circulation throughout the body. Massage also lowers levels of the stress hormone cortisol and promotes the release of pain-killing endorphins in the brain.<br></p><p>Clients receiving ongoing massage therapy from Massage Envy report a sense of mental clarity and an increased ability to turn off stressors and achieve optimal rest and relaxation.<br></p><p>Massage also increases blood flow to sore, painful muscles, bringing in healing oxygen and nutrients and helping remove waste products in muscles. The result: less swelling and stiffness and increased flexibility to help eliminate pain.<br></p><p>Because massage helps ease stress, strain and pain, you're more calm and relaxed and better prepared for quality, restorative sleep.<br></p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $49. Memberships are available for $59 per month and include a one-hour massage session.

<p>ROWLETT, TX&nbsp;-- Feb 23, 2012 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Within the Massage Envy universe, the Rowlett Massage Envy Spa latest achievement may be a first -- for the third consecutive year, the Regional Therapist of the Year has been chosen from the Rowlett clinic. Alisyn Schreiber is the 2011 honoree. And the clinic, owned by Dr. Richard and April Klics, won't even celebrate its fifth anniversary until March 16, 2012.</p><p>Alisyn currently is Lead Therapist at Massage Envy Spa Rowlett and has been full time with the clinic for two years. She is a very busy woman. In 2011, she performed almost 1500 hours of massage in addition to scheduling, hiring and training massage therapists. A popular therapist, requested therapist bookings make up 65 percent of her schedule.<br></p><p>Schreiber said, "I am so excited and honored. I love my job and helping people, and I am so lucky to be able to make a living doing something I love. Then to win an award like this -- I could hardly sleep for days after I found out. I am so happy I came to work for Massage Envy Spa in Rowlett."<br></p><p>Dr. Klics commented, "Alisyn has grown a lot in the last year as a person and a therapist. Though she is still quite young, she impresses everyone she meets with her knowledge and experience. She regularly initiates and works on community projects in order to help those in need. But best of all, Alisyn always has a big smile and words of encouragement for everyone she sees. Staff and clients alike love her for her knowledge and appreciate her patience and kindness."<br></p><p>She joins 2009 Regional Therapist of the Year Jason Michaels and 2010 Regional Therapist of the Year Nina Almandarez. Both are still with Massage Envy Spa Rowlett. Having three Therapists of the Year on staff is both a special accomplishment and source of pride for the clinic.<br></p><p>"The first time was a shock, we really didn't expect it since there are so many large and successful clinics in the DFW region," says Dr. Klics. "The second year we knew that we had all worked hard and felt so honored and humbled to have won the award in back to back years. But to win it for a third straight year is just beyond words. I am so proud of my people and all their hard work and dedication to the profession. It is nice to be recognized, but we accept this award with great humility and thanks to our friends and the Massage Envy brand for their support."<br></p><p>Alisyn is looking forward to attending the annual conference Massage Envy Corporate holds in Phoenix, Arizona, each year. The Regional Therapists of the Year from all around the country are honored at an awards ceremony.<br></p><p>Massage Envy Spa Rowlett is located at 4301 Lakeview Parkway, Suite 600, Rowlett.<br></p><p>With today's fast pace and hectic schedules, everyone can benefit from facials and therapeutic massage.

"Along with growing demand for therapeutic massage, we will be adding facials and spa services in the next 30 days, so our growth curve should continue upward."<br></p><p>There's more to the spa's growth than revenues. Massage Envy SPA -- Preston Park Village has moved to a new 3,500-square foot location at 1900 Preston Road, Suite 201, Plano TX 75093 (972) 964-0600, adding two rooms and separate waiting areas for spa and massage clients.<br></p><p>The Plano Preston Park Village site is the first in the DFW area to incorporate new Massage Envy specifications for color schemes. "It's a relaxed and welcoming environment where our clients will feel right at home," Mr. McGovern said. "We've evolved from a neighborhood location to a regional resource for spa and massage services."<br></p><p>The Massage Envy Spa -- Preston Park Village therapists offer specialized massage expertise, including pre-natal, hot stone, reflexology and trigger points. To attract experienced therapists, the McGoverns offer employment packages that include major medical and paid vacations for full-time employees. All four of the McGovern's clinics are actively hiring certified massage therapists, certified estheticians and sales associates.<br></p><p>Winners of numerous Massage Envy awards for excellence in franchising, the McGoverns were the first Massage Envy franchisees in the DFW area, opening their Old Town site on Greenville Avenue in Dallas in 2005. Over the past five years, Old Town has been the second busiest Massage Envy in the United States.<br></p><p>With today's fast pace and hectic schedules, North Texans are benefiting from facials and therapeutic massage.

Only seven Massage Envy locations closed in the three-year period 2008-2010.<br></p><p>"Forbes reported what our franchisees already know: Massage Envy is a great value that delivers 'bang for the buck,'" said Lance O'Pry, Dallas-Fort Worth regional developer for Massage Envy.

<p>Customized Facials Will Use Murad(R) Skincare Products<br></p><p>Allen, Texas -- Apr 12, 2012 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- Massage Envy's Allen clinic is now Massage Envy Spa Allen. In addition to regular massage services, the spa now offers customized facials using Murad(R) Skincare Products, says Jim Kennedy, owner of Massage Envy Spa Allen.</p><p>Just as massage can help deal with everyday stresses, so can facials. Your skin's appearance and health can suffer due to products applied to the face, poor diet, illness and pollution. Regular facials increase circulation, reverse visible signs of aging, improve skin tone and texture, and help eliminate blemishes and breakouts, particularly those caused by stress.<br></p><p>"Our new spa services offer a new relaxing dimension for our clients," Kennedy said. "Our guests are really excited about adding facials to their visits. We have just added four new dual-purpose treatment rooms to handle facials." Massage Envy Spa Allen is located at 816 W. McDermott Dr., Suite 340 in Allen, and is the tenth Massage Envy Spa in Dallas/Fort Worth.<br></p><p>Massage Envy Spa's Murad(R) Healthy Skin Facials feature specially formulated products from world-renowned Murad, Inc. Because skin cells lose the ability to retain water as they age, Murad products are specially formulated to repair cell membranes while attracting water and nutrients to the cells. This unmatched approach makes Massage Envy Spa's Murad Healthy Skin Facials the most effective way to achieve balanced and more youthful-looking skin.<br></p><p>Massage Envy Spa Allen offers a variety of skincare treatments that benefit every skin type, including:<br></p><p> AHA Rapid Exfoliator Anti-Aging Facial helps reveal smoother, vibrant, younger-looking skin.<br> Clarifying Enzyme Acne Facial improves skin clarity, reduces blemishes and soothes inflammation.<br> Environmental Shield Vitamin C Infusion Facial reverses signs of aging caused by environmental factors such as sunlight, smog, pollution and stress.<br> Sensitive Skin Facial repairs and balances the skin with a gentle, yet effective treatment designed specifically to address skin that is easily irritated or sensitive.</p><p>"Massage Envy takes the same dedicated approach to skin care as it does to massage, so our guests know they are in the hands of professionals who understand their needs," says Lance O'Pry, Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Developer for Massage Envy. "We are happy to offer yet another service that helps our customers look and feel their best."<br></p><p>Because of Massage Envy's high standards for employees performing facials, only estheticians licensed by the state of Texas were hired for the Allen spa. They underwent extensive training, led by both a Massage Envy trainer and two Murad representatives.<br></p><p>Like massages, facials at Massage Envy are reasonably priced. The introductory price for any of the four signature facials is just $59. Clients can have a facial for only $10 more than the regular Massage Envy massage therapy price.<br></p><p>With today's fast pace and hectic schedules, everyone can benefit from facials and therapeutic massage. Visit one of the 28 Dallas/Fort Worth Massage Envy clinics to learn more about how massage therapy helps people relax and de-stress.<br></p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $49.

<p>Recognizes Coppell Employee for Good Citizenship<br></p><p>Dallas Fort Worth, TX&nbsp;-- Apr 16, 2012 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- In honor of National Volunteer Week -- April 15-21 -- Massage Envy is encouraging its employees to give back to the community. As part of that initiative, Massage Envy is saluting Carrollton resident Stephanie Bush, a massage therapist at Massage Envy Coppell, for her outstanding and continued service to the community.</p><p>"Stephanie has a heart for giving. She volunteers for several charities, most notably, her work with HomelessPartners.com and its Christmas Wish program, where she is in charge of arranging donations for homeless folks around the Metroplex. She also is involved with Massage Envy's Arthritis Foundation initiatives, and for several months, she donated all of her tips to help a co-worker who was out injured," said Ashley Martin, clinic manager at Massage Envy Coppell.<br></p><p>Bush has been a massage therapist for five years. She says she chose this career for the same reason that she does charity work -- she enjoys helping people.<br></p><p>"As a massage therapist, I really enjoy seeing the benefits the clients have when they receive a massage. They may come in with a migraine and leave without one or they may have a lower-back problem that we're able to help solve. I love helping people. I just want to do everything I can to help those around me," said Bush.<br></p><p>Bush got her start in charity work about eight years ago, while living in Las Vegas and working for a bagel shop. Store policy was to throw away uneaten bagels at the end of the day, but Bush had other ideas.<br></p><p>"I just couldn't stand throwing away a huge, five gallon bag of bagels while there were so many people who didn't have enough to eat, so I started taking the bags downtown and giving them to the homeless. It really opened up my eyes and my heart to homelessness. That's why I'm involved with HomelessPartners.com. People often have a negative perspective on homelessness, but this program allows them to see homeless people for who they really are," said Bush.<br></p><p>HomelessPartners.com allows homeless men, women and children to tell their stories, and at Christmas time, make a "wish list" of what they need most. People can log onto the site and donate items on the wish lists -- coats, hats, gloves, socks and shoes are some of the most common wished-for items.<br></p><p>In addition to her work with HomelessPartners.com, Bush is actively involved with HOPE worldwide, an organization that's dedicated to assisting economically disadvantaged people around the world. Bush participates in a number of HOPE worldwide programs locally, including a fire safety campaign and an educational program for inner-city children. She's also involved with Massage Envy's charitable work with the Arthritis Foundation.<br></p><p>"Massage Envy does several programs to help support the Arthritis Foundation. Right now we're helping with the 'Let's Move Together' program, which encourages people to move every day to prevent or treat arthritis. We also host the 'Healing Hands for Arthritis' fundraiser in October.

<p>On May 9, with just a cheek swab, find out if you're a match<br></p><p>Rowlett, Texas -- Apr 23, 2012 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- The staff at Massage Envy Spa-Rowlett Crossing will host a drive for bone marrow donors on May 9, 2012.</p><p>Fundraising in support of bone marrow donations began April 1 at the spa, with all proceeds going to the Be the Match Foundation. On May 9, Massage Envy staff and clients can take a simple cheek swab to see if they are a bone marrow match. The spa is located at 4301 Lakeview Parkway, Suite 600, in Rowlett.<br></p><p>"Our publicist, Jo Trizila, a bone marrow recipient herself, inspired us to conduct the drive," said Dr. Richard Klics, owner of the Massage Envy Spa - Rowlett Crossing. "The profound and amazing truth is that a single bone marrow donor can save a life. A cheek swab makes it easy to determine if you're a bone marrow match. Take a moment and save a life."<br></p><p>You do not have to be a member of Massage Envy to participate. Walk-in volunteers for the swab test are welcome. The clinic is located at 4301 Lakeview Parkway Suite 600, Rowlett, TX 75089.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Bone marrow donors have the power to heal, Dr. Klics said. For some 10,000 patients a year with leukemia and other life-threatening diseases, their only hope for a second chance at life is a marrow transplant from someone outside their family.</p><p>Patients and their families count on the National Marrow Donor Program and the Be the Match Foundation. Over the past 25 years the donor program has made 50,000 transplants possible, bringing hope to thousands more each year.<br></p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $49. Memberships are available for $59 per month and include a one-hour massage session.

<p>Focus and courage of Frisco cyclist energizes Massage Envy owner<br></p><p>Dallas Fort Worth, TX&nbsp;-- Apr 26, 2012 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) --&nbsp;Massage Envy&nbsp;DFW will sponsor a cycling team for the&nbsp;Bike MS: Sam's Club 2012 Ride.</p><p>Brendan McBratney, owner of&nbsp;Massage Envy's&nbsp;Craig Ranch &amp; Stonebriar clinics and the Frisco North Spa, has sponsored Riders Against MS as the&nbsp;Massage Envy&nbsp;team for the past four years.<br></p><p>Rodney Moffitt, a resident of Frisco, was diagnosed with MS seven years ago and is the founder of Riders Against MS. Moffitt sums up his attitude: "Don't let MS control your life, but take control of your MS through your exercise or things you want to do, and do it as long as you can. I know someday I might be in a wheelchair, but until that day comes, I'm going to ride."<br></p><p>"Rodney's focus and courage energizes me, the riders and everyone at&nbsp;Massage Envy," McBratney said. The&nbsp;Massage Envy&nbsp;team is aiming to raise more than $15,000 this year. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Scheduled for Saturday and Sunday, May 5-6, 2012, the 150+-mile fundraiser benefits the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Lone Star Chapter.<br></p><p>The ride begins at 7 a.m. Saturday at Frisco's Dr. Pepper Ballpark. After an overnight pit stop at Texas Motor Speedway, cyclists will loop back on Sunday for a new raceway finish. An estimated 3,000 riders are expected to take part. The ride is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year.<br></p><p>The&nbsp;Massage Envy&nbsp;tent at Texas Motor Speedway will be a gathering place for riders after they bike 85 miles Saturday.&nbsp;Massage Envytherapists will provide massages to&nbsp;Massage Envy&nbsp;team members and other cyclists in preparation for Sunday's ride. The riders are extremely grateful for the massage to help recover from the first day's ride as it helps tremendously preparing for day two.&nbsp;Massage Envy&nbsp;is the leading provider of massage therapy in the U.S.<br></p><p>Massage Envy's sports massage therapy is geared toward athletes of every kind, from world-class professionals to weekend joggers to cyclists. Licensed massage therapists focus on areas of the body that are overused and stressed from repetitive and often aggressive movements.<br></p><p>Aspects of sports massage therapy are gaining popularity as useful components in a balanced training regimen. Sports massage therapy can be used as a means to enhance pre-event preparation and reduce recovery time for maximum performance during training or after an event. Athletes have discovered that specially designed sports massage promotes flexibility, reduces fatigue, improves endurance, helps prevent injuries and prepares their body and mind for optimal performance.<br></p><p>One of the key benefits of&nbsp;Massage Envy's&nbsp;sports massage therapy compared to other modalities is its ability to target muscle-tendon junctions. A 2010 study in&nbsp;The Journal of&nbsp;Strength and Conditioning Research&nbsp;found that even a 30-second massage improved hip-flexor range of motion. Another study conducted by Margaret Jones, Ph.D. of the American College of Sports Medicine, demonstrated a notable trend toward decreased muscle soreness in the athletes who received massage either before or after exercise.<br></p><p>Signup continues until the day of the race. Some 2,856 riders took part last year.

<p>Dallas Fort Worth, TX&nbsp;-- May 29, 2012 / (<a href="http://www.myprgenie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.myprgenie.com</a>) -- It started in the middle of the night -- a blinding pain that woke Corby Davidson up from a sound sleep. His first thought: "I'm dying."</p><p>The pain in the marathon runner's back was excruciating but, luckily for Davidson, not actually life-threatening.<br></p><p>"I started running marathons about 10 years ago. Three years ago I woke up in the middle of the night, and the pain was so bad I thought, 'This is it. I'm dying.' The next day, I went to a chiropractor who suggested several things to improve my core strength and alleviate that pain, such as sit-ups, working with the big exercise ball and massage therapy," explained Davidson.<br></p><p>While training for a marathon, Davidson says he runs at least 10 miles a day. But even when he isn't training, he runs between 30 and 45 miles per week and continues with his massage therapy.<br></p><p>"Whatever sport you're doing, you need to do massage therapy in addition to your cardio and strength training. It's an integral part of your exercise program," said Davidson. "It helps heal injuries, improves athletic performance and increases your range of motion. It's maintenance -- like going to the gym. If you stick with it, it will pay off."<br></p><p>Davidson has met his personal competition goals and has participated in a number of marathons. He ran the New York City Marathon twice, the Chicago Marathon once and the Dallas White Rock Marathon four times. But, although running is something he's passionate about, it's not his day job. Davidson is co-host of the popular Cumulus radio show "Hardline," which airs from 3 to 7 p.m. weekdays on The Ticket Sports Radio, 1310 AM and 104.1 FM in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.<br></p><p>"We spend four hours a day sitting in a chair, chatting about sports. It's great!" said Davidson.<br></p><p>When he isn't running marathons or hosting a radio show, Davidson spends most of his free time with his family hitting golf balls at the driving range and giving his youngest piggy-back rides.<br></p><p>"I used to play a ton of golf before I had kids, and now I'm slowly getting back into it. My son is getting interested in it now and so is our 2-year-old, so that helps. We go to the driving range as a family and hit balls together," explained Davidson.<br></p><p>Davidson, also is a former football player, doesn't have complete range of motion in his shoulder due to an old injury. He has roughly 95% range of motion now and says his massage therapist is working with him to get to 100%.<br></p><p>"Hopefully, I'll have full range back in a few months," said Davidson. "If you're an active guy like me -- doing sports, exercising or have kids running around, I highly recommend a massage at least every other week."<br></p><p>Davidson added, "If you go to Massage Envy, you'll be in good company. When I go there, it's usually 60-40, girls to guys."<br></p><p>At Massage Envy, an introductory one-hour massage session (a 50-minute massage and time for consultation and dressing) is just $49. Memberships are available for $59 per month and include a one-hour massage session.

<p>On August 2nd, over 300 hundred young people from all corners of the world will assemble in Wiesbaden, Germany for cultural exchange, learning, and most importantly: a celebration. What they will be celebrating is a constructed language, Esperanto, at the 71st Esperanto Youth Congress. italki, the largest Peer-to-Peer 1-on-1 online language education platform is proud to be the only language education company to be sponsoring this event.</p><p><b>The Event:</b> </p><p>The World Esperanto Youth Organization (Tutmonda Esperantista Junulara Organizo) TEJO, has created the Esperanto Youth Congress (Internacia Junulara Kongreso, or just IJK) to encourage the youth involved in the Esperanto movement to share their experience. </p><p>Most importantly, this event allows Esperanto speakers to practice speaking the language within a community, reinforcing the international applicability of the language. Many of the participants may still be starting out in the language, and being able to reinforce the acquisition socially, through one-on-one communication in a friendly atmosphere helps preserve and encourage the community around this language.</p><p>The IJK started in 1938, in the The Netherlands, and is seeing its 71st iteration. The event has been held in multiple countries, and is the largest such event oriented specifically at encouraging younger speakers to improve and perfect their communicative Esperanto ability, and encourage a new generation of practitioners of the language.</p><p>The Youth congress generally sees several hundred Esperantists between 18 - 35, who share a passion for "the language of hope" and the ideals of open cross-cultural communication.</p><p><b>italki involvement:</b></p><p>italki has sponsored previous events like the Polyglot Gathering in Berlin (<a href="http://polyglotberlin.com/">http://polyglotberlin.com/</a>) and sees its role in the new language learning environment as that of supporting linguistic diversity, inter-personal learning, and effective, learn-by-doing approaches to education by connecting language learners with fluent or native-speaking teachers of any language, no matter where in the world those students or teachers may be.</p><p>Considering that Esperanto is a language without a country, going home after an event can mean leaving the Esperanto community except for online connections. Working together with the event organizers, italki is providing an online community and online teachers, and hopes to encourage enthusiastic new Esperanto speakers to keep practicing what they learned during the event.</p><p>More importantly, the spirit of the Esperanto culture (by nature multi-national, inclusive, and communication-oriented) aligns with the way that italki celebrates language learning and the important human connections that inevitably come with it.</p><p>It is italki's mission to make learning a language an interpersonal, accessible, and affordable experience. Celebrating and supporting the Esperanto community and IJK simply falls within the company's core beliefs. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Follow the conference on Twitter: @IJK2015</p><p>Follow italki on Twitter: @italki</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>About Italki: </p><p>Starting as a language exchange social network in 2007, italki has become a multi-million user platform for language learners and educators to find one another, hold individual language classes, and participate in a collaborative learning and community-building experience. The italki platform has become a hub of the language-learning online ecosystem, that is able to bring effective and affordable language-learning to every place on Earth. As of 2015, italki has helped or is helping over 1.8 million users approach fluency in a foreign language.</p><p>In 2015, in the midst of the trend away from traditional education and towards self-directed, truly personal knowledge discovery, italki provides the platform to find affordable authentic language-learning solutions created by a truly global community of language-learning enthusiasts, including polyglots, translators, and professional language teachers.</p><p>For any further questions please contact: ivan@italki.com</p>

<p>Introducing the newest member of the Cogo Labs family of companies, Tenizen! </p><p>Launched on January 1, 2015 and already profitable and growing, Tenizen is poised to radically alter and improve the apartment rental experience.</p><p>Our goal is to take what is currently an unpleasant process for both tenants and landlords and improve the entire experience, from the listing of the apartment to the signing of the lease, says CEO Jacob Silber.&nbsp; The products were building will not only modernize the experience in ways that are long overdue, but transform and elevate it, not just for renters, but for rental agents and landlords as well.</p><p>Being part of the Cogo Labs incubator has been an invaluable experience for Silber and his team. The startup world can be very lonely. At Cogo Labs youre both cooperating with and learning from other companies who are rushing to solve similar problems in different industries. It provides a motivation and comradery thats often missing when youre operating as a solo startup in a shared work space.</p><p>Tenizen currently consists of 8 full-time and 2 part-time employees, and theyre looking to grow in a number of areas in the coming months, including analytics, software development, and business development.</p><p>If youve ever rented an apartment than you know all too well what a frustrating process it can be, Silber says. If youre excited about the potential for the apartment rentals market to be drastically improved, and want to be part of the team thats going to make it happen, wed love to hear from you.</p><p>For more information about Tenizen, visit <a href="http://www.tenizen.com/" target="_blank">their website</a>.</p>

<p>A womans jewelry changes with her mood, her style and the seasons. The massive Jinja Jewelry collection incorporates an endless array of style for any occasion. Inspired by the warm Bali beaches, Jinja has several designs that are perfect for the summer and range from bracelets to earrings to pendants. All of these <a href="http://www.jinjajewelry.net/" target="_blank">handcrafted jewelry pieces</a>&nbsp;use top quality materials from the earth to tell a different story, unique to the woman wearing the jewelry.</p><p><br></p><p>Summer Cuffs</p><p><br></p><p><img width="275" alt="banglepng" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/122428/bangle-png" height="194"></p><p><br></p><p>This stainless steel cuff from the Jinja Jewelry collection intertwines shades of marsala and aqua. Both hues were mentioned in this years Pantone Color of the year palette. While marsala is noted as the primary color of 2015, shades of aqua, turquoise and blue are listed as honorary compliments. This cuff offsets the darkness of marsala with pleasant summer tones while playing up the boho chic trend widely coveted during warmer seasons.</p><p><br></p><p>Summer Hoops&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><img width="224" alt="earringspng" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/122428/earrings-png" height="225"></p><p><br></p><p>The best time of year to wear hoop earrings is during summer. Their gypsy flare and flirtatious nature pairs perfectly with maxi dresses, kimonos and all the summer staples in between. This large set of earrings modernizes the traditional hoop earring with its oblique oval shape. These earrings also deviate from the use of gold that is most commonly used in hoop earrings. Instead, Jinja uses 100% sterling silver for a smart approach to around-the-way hoops.</p><p><br></p><p>Summer Pendants&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><img width="225" alt="pendantpng" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/122428/pendant-png" height="266"></p><p><br></p><p>Nothing says summer more than beach emblems. Several of the pendants from the Jinja Jewelry collection are reminiscent of trinkets washed up at the seashore. These one-of-a-kind interchangeable pendants are a favorite for their boundless versatility and top quality craftsmanship. The pendant pictured above takes a sophisticated approach to the metallic trend in this sterling silver tear drop. It uses mother of pearl and abalone shell for a polished look.</p><p><br></p><p>Summer Night Necklace</p><p><br></p><p><img width="250" alt="necklacepng" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/122428/necklace-png" height="231"></p><p><br></p><p>Many women enjoy wearing jewelry that doesnt take such a literal approach to summer through elements like flowers and sun stars. Instead these women like pieces that play into traditional summer elements in a more subtle way. The piece pictured above is reminiscent of the stones youd find by a pond or a lake in warmer months. Its uniquely progressive color story mirrors a clear summer night sky.</p><p><br></p><p>Marsala Rings&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><img width="250" alt="ringpng" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/122428/ring-png" height="247"></p><p><br></p><p>Marsala and shades of red have trumped the runways this year. Incorporating this bold color in your jewelry is great way to play with the trend. Adding a pop of color in your look is a great idea and is easy to accomplish via your jewelry. This piece from the Jinja collection uses sterling silver, rich crimson and coral shades to tell one perfect summer story.</p><p><br></p><p>Abstract Summer Rings&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><img width="250" alt="abstractringpng" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/122428/abstractring-png" height="212"></p><p><br></p><p>Abstract jewelry will always turn heads and make statements. For women who want to make statements through fashion but dont want to be overbearing, wearing jewelry that makes robust statements allows you to reach a healthy medium between flashy and understated. Abstract pieces like the ring shown above mirror all the fun of summertime. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Unique Summer Bangles&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><img width="275" alt="banglepng" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/122428/bangle-png" height="194"></p><p><br></p><p>A summer jewelry collection would be virtually incomplete without a bangle. Wrapped around your wrist the traditional way or placed on your arm for added flare, a bangle is meant to be a conversation starter. This sterling silver piece uses a unique swirl design.</p><p><br></p><p>Note to Media: To set up an interview with creator of the Jinja Jewelry collection Elaine Helmig or to request samples and hi-res images, please contact Giselle Diaz at&nbsp;<a target="_blank">giselle@socialmedia22.com</a>&nbsp;or call Tasha Mayberry at 207.317.6099. </p><p><br></p><p>###</p>

<p>In the last few years, whenever the topic of Bitcoin arose among financial services industry professionals, it provoked either negative connotations associated with reputed criminal uses such as money laundering or outright dismissal as something only Silicon Valley tech-libertarians would be interested in. In the last year or so, the tone of conversation on the topic has shifted as respected names in the industry like NYSE and Goldman Sachs have revealed not just interest in Bitcoin but plans to invest in the technology.</p><p>Bitcoin is innovative because it allows individuals to exchange value across the Internet without the involvement of trusted third parties that may impose costs or delays. The most obvious application of such a technology would be in the payments space, particularly in enabling cross-border remittances. However, Mercator Advisory Groups most recent research report,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWVyY2F0b3JhZHZpc29yeWdyb3VwLmNvbS9SZXBvcnRzL1VuZGVyc3RhbmRpbmctQml0Y29pbl8tQmxvY2tjaGFpbi1BcHBsaWNhdGlvbnMtQmV5b25kLVBheW1lbnRzLw==" rel="nofollow">Understanding Bitcoin: Blockchain Applications Beyond Payments</a>&nbsp;argues that this is just one of the many applications possible with this technology and by no means the most interesting one. The blockchain could fundamentally alter a whole range of services that today require middlemen to maintain centralized databases. These applications range from using bitcoins to trade real-world assets like securities or land titles to structuring smart contracts that could pave the way for on-demand services like Airbnb without the need for an Airbnb to act as the middleman.</p><p>The shared ledger known as the blockchain represents a global consensus of events that have happened up until the latest block, all in the form of Bitcoin transactions.

Utilizing the entire range of possible shutter speeds with the Priolite Hot Sync System allows photographers to shoot with wide-open apertures in sunlit environments, freezing motion of fast moving objects, and enables them to create images difficult or impossible to capture before. The ability to remotely control high-powered battery operated studio strobes anywhere between 17 w/s and up to 1000 w/s per light3 with the Priolite Remote Control opens up endless possibilities for creatives all around the world.   </p><p>High-powered strobe photography at shutter speeds of up to 1/4000th of a second, combined with the ability to operate any of the Priolite Hot Sync strobes at any power setting and without the need for an outlet, truly represents a quantum leap forward for all owners of Pentax medium format cameras, says Joachim Renschke, the CEO and founder of Priolite GmbH. By using the 2.4 GHz spectrum, the Priolite Remote Control supports 4 groups, 9 different IDs in each group, 1/10th of a stop power adjustments, and remote control of modeling lights wherever your next assignment might take you.

It enables Medium Format flash photography in a way impossible before, and with no need for leaf-shutter lenses. The 645Z can now reliably sync at up to 1/4000th of a second, making it the ultimate and most sophisticated tool amongst professionals looking for high resolution, high image quality, and high speed flash photography. Unlike other systems that can sync with flash lights at no more than 1/1600th of a second, Priolites solution is a clear game changer in the world of photography, says Alex Munoz, professional still and motion photographer from Los Angeles, California. <br></p><p><br></p><p><b><u>Main Features</u></b>  </p><p>Support Flash Sync speed on HSS enabled Pentax cameras up to 1/8000th of a second<br></p><p>Hot Sync works over the entire power range of the strobe from 17 w/s up to 1000 w/s (MBX/M-Pack 1000 HS)  </p><p>Wirelessly trigger and control Priolite strobes with the Priolite Remote Control (2.4 GHz)</p>  <p>Control Priolite strobes in 4 groups with 9 device IDs individually; control modeling lights</p>  <p>Provide up to 1000 w/s per light/head with a maximum of 220 full-power flashes per charge (MBX 500 HS)</p>  <p>Li-Ion powered (MBX and M-Pack series), no memory effect</p>  <p>Made in Germany with a 2 year warranty</p>  <p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>  <p><b><u>Content</u></b></p>  <p>Product introduction and first look video <b><a href="http://priolite.us/pentax_hss/">http://priolite.us/pentax_hss/</a></b></p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><b><u>Contact</u></b></p>  <p>PRIOLITE</p>  <p>888.818.7335 (Ext. 800)</p>  <p>hss@priolite.us</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><b><u>Sales</u></b></p>  <p><a href="http://www.priolite.us">www.priolite.us</a></p>  <p></p><br>

<p>When personal trainer Jennifer Johnson gave birth to her son Cole, she had to find a way to stay active while giving her baby the attention he needed. Cole was a high needs baby, so he would never let Jennifer put him down. Jennifer began taking walks carrying Cole and soon incorporated stair workouts and hills using him as her weight for resistance exercises. They both loved the daily workouts and time together and Jennifer got in great post-pregnancy shape. Her experience inspired her to create <a href="http://www.babystrongworkout.com/" target="_blank">Baby Strong Workout</a>, a set of cards featuring innovative, fun and effective mommy &amp; me exercises and customizable workouts. Jennifer has just launched Baby Strong on Kickstarter to help more moms get active and feel good post-pregnancy!</p><p><br></p><p>Moms may have every intention to work out after having a baby but, more often than not, find it near impossible to find the time or money to do so. Moms end up giving up on essential mommy care and as a result, dont feel good about themselves. Its not just about fitting into your pre-pregnancy jeans or losing the baby weight  its about feeling healthy, confident and strong. When I had my son and literally couldnt ever put him down, I knew I had to figure something out to be able to take care of myself without neglecting his needs. I experienced firsthand how great the Baby Strong exercises worked to get me in shape, tried them out on clients and test groups, and then I knew I had to find a way to help other moms, shares Jennifer Johnson, perinatal exercise specialist and inventor of Baby Strong.</p><p><br></p><p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.babystrongworkout.com/" target="_blank">Baby Strong exercise cards</a>&nbsp;all feature real moms and their babies to show how customizable the program is for moms of all shapes, sizes, and fitness levels. The exercises help moms build functional strength to do all the things a mom needs to get done each day. Baby is held by mom in every single exercise so mom doesnt have to find a sitter or deal with unnecessary tears or guilt so she can get in a daily workout. With Baby Strong, babys need to be close to mom is met while moms need to take care of herself doesnt have to be compromised. The Baby Strong card program is fun, effective, inexpensive, and portable so it can be carried in a diaper bag or purse for whenever mom needs a pick-me-up.</p><p><br></p><p><img width="450" alt="preorderpng" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/112592/preorder-png" height="236"></p><p><br></p><p>Features:<br></p><p><br></p><ul><br><li>Deck of workout cards held together with a teething ring link</li><br><li>Baby Safe: chew, drool and baby-friendly material used for cards</li><br><li>Text and photo instructions included for each exercise</li><br><li>Follow pre-made workouts or customize your own</li><br></ul><p><br></p><p>Benefits:</p><p><br></p><ul><br><li>Workout with ONLY mom + baby!</li><br><li>No gym, no classes, no special equipment</li><br><li>Created for moms of all shapes, sizes and fitness levels</li><br><li>Helps moms feel strong, healthy, happy, and confident</li><br><li>Fun, effective, and inexpensive workout for moms</li><br><li>Mommy Care + Baby Care</li><br><li>No Tears.

As a member of the Blackfoot tribe, Ryan looked for a way to find a connection to his language and culture.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p> After serving in the military, he reconnected with his heritage by studying the history and language. He went on to design courses in Blackfoot culture that relied on field observation of the cycles of life and seasonal changes in the environment, as well as cultural artefacts called bundles that represented mans contract with the natural world.</p><p>Ryan is not alone in speaking an endangered language. In North America alone there are hundreds of languages that are considered in danger, many of them heritage languages.</p><p>While there are traditional efforts made in preserving endangered languages: through UNESCO and funds dedicated to the task, internet technologies are making language preservation much easier. Online resources are maintained by organizations and enthusiasts.</p><p>Ryan is unique, however, in his approach to help preserve his language and traditions. He is pursuing an educational model that touches on the living aspects of the language: the cultural mindset and perception of the world that cannot be captured in books or recordings.</p><p>He has started his own educational initiative centered around Blackfoot language and culture. He is also teaching the language online, through a language-education platform called italki, in order to teach his beloved subject to a global audience. He has had students take his classes from places as diverse as Germany and China. This diversity of interest from the rest of the world offsets the apathy that is often found towards Native languages in reservation communities, and serves as an indicator that there is hope for recovery of endangered languages and cultures through online education. </p><p><b>Additional Resources: </b></p><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/75446810">https://vimeo.com/75446810</a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSvn--lTQsg" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSvn--lTQsg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSvn--lTQsg</a></p><p></p><p><a href="http://www.theecologist.org/Guides/The_Ecologist_Guide_to_Skills_and_Courses/2007750/enlivened_learning_at_red_crow_community_college.html" title="Link: http://www.theecologist.org/Guides/The_Ecologist_Guide_to_Skills_and_Courses/2007750/enlivened_learning_at_red_crow_community_college.html">http://www.theecologist.org/Guides/The_Ecologist_Guide_to_Skills_and_Courses/2007750/enlivened_learning_at_red_crow_community_college.html</a></p>
<p>Going abroad to spend time making a better world can be a tough decision, but that is only the first of many sacrifices that a Peace Corps volunteer must makes. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>One of the challenges of going into isolated places in the world can pose for a Peace Corps volunteer is the language. Though the volunteers are smart, well-educated people that are looking to help, the language resources available to them before landing in-country can be quite scarce. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>So much of the work a volunteer does depends on her ability to pick up a foreign language in only 3 months of training (which happens AFTER she arrives to her assignment in-country).</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>For Kelsey, the possibility of being able to start this process early is a game-changer. She is about to embark on a tour of duty in Malawi, needing to acquire Chewa. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Much to her surprise her friend recommended to look for a native Chewa speaker online. She lucked out when she found an italki user who is a native fluent speaker of the language, Friday <a href="http://www.italki.com/user/2098564">http://www.italki.com/user/2098564</a>.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Kelsey was so excited she got in touch with italki, asking us to encourage him to apply to be a teacher of the language on the platform.

<p>Russian culture and freedom of expression has been under pressure in recent years. This includes, oddly enough, the ancient and mystical oral art of mat, or the Russian curse language. This form of cultural expression is colorful and linguistically intriguing (entire conversations can be had in nothing but blush-inducing, hair-raising, and often hilarious use of cursing, aided by Russian grammatical flexibility and a flair for the literary so inherent in Russian culture).<br></p><p><b><br></b></p><p>It has, however, been banned in Russia since June 2014, putting many works of literature, film, and music into the category of illegal expression. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Though censorship is not new to any Russian, the cultural landscape has changed significantly with the changes in media distribution models brought on by the internet. Krovostok records and profane films propagate online through Torrents, social networks (especially VK, where a large amount of Russian music is available to play streaming for free). </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>The resources of a connected world are even making an impact in the educational sphere. Besides the ability to learn proper Russian through a multitude of services, apps like DuoLingo and Memrise, it is possible to learn the art of mat from a teacher on italki, a social network and marketplace for language-learners: <a href="http://www.italki.com/course/34641" title="Link: http://www.italki.com/course/34641">http://www.italki.com/course/34641</a></p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Anna Wiazemsky is offering a cursing course for advanced Russian students, giving anyone dedicated to learning Russian the ability to become uniquely fluent in a way no other educational program would be able to achieve. </p><p><br></p>
<p>The era of globalization is giving the world more than anxiety over ethical manufacturing practices. It is also creating the ability for individuals to truly make a difference on a personal, human scale. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Meet Derek, a man from Java who has found a way to make a difference by teaching children English and music in Colombia. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>He is funding his teaching efforts by giving Indonesian and English lessons on italki.com, a platform for language exhange and one-on-one language classes with teachers in over 100 languages. <a href="http://www.italki.com/teacher/2605559">http://www.italki.com/teacher/2605559</a> </p><p><br></p><p>A touching element of his teaching strategy is that he uses his Indonesian lessons online to fund his ability to volunteer and continue educating children in Pereira, Colombia.

<p>SAN JOSE, CA  Opera San José recently completed its 31st season with the Irene Dalis Memorial Concert. Dalis, who founded Opera San José in 1984, passed away last December at the age of 89. More than 20 current and former members of Opera San Josés resident company, accompanied by the Opera San José Orchestra and Chorus, performed some of Daliss most memorable excerpts from her extraordinary career. The capacity audience from across the community, celebrating the legacy of Irene Dalis, was a testament to her contribution to the quality of life in our region. Opera San Josés 201415 season also featured an impressive range of works at the California Theatre beginning in September 2014 with a production of Verdis dramatic Rigoletto, a tale of a brutalized court jester determined to protect his daughter from a decadent court and a duke who seduces and abandons women. Heather Morris of Peninsula Reviews wrote, Baritone Matthew Hanscoms Rigoletto was superb. He took us along his emotional roller coaster ride with a wonderfully versatile voice, full of expressive personality and technical prowess. The company followed Rigoletto in November with Rossinis comedy The Italian Girl in Algiers, a tale of a clever Italian girl shipwrecked in a foreign land while searching for her lover, but finding herself the focus of a powerful sultans unwanted affections. Kevin Kirby of The Metro said, From the very first note of the overture, you know you are in good hands musically. Luke's orchestra responds like a finely tuned Italian sports car, and the acoustics of the California Theatre allow the ensemble to show off its full dynamic range while never overpowering the singers.<br></p>
<p>Beijing, June 30 2015  Baidu Nuomi, a leading O2O (Online to Offline) service, today unveiled its Membership Plus O2O ecosystem strategy. At a press conference held this morning in Beijing, Baidu chairman and CEO Robin Li also announced that Baidu would invest RMB 20 billion over the next three years to expand the life services platform.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I took a look yesterday, and right now Baidu has over fifty billion RMB in cash on its books. Were going to take 20 billion of that and do Nuomi right, said Li.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Baidu Nuomi estimates that it will occupy the number two position in its category by the end of the year, as measured in sales proceeds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Baidu Nuomis Membership Plus strategy will help merchants establish their own marketing platforms to increase user retention rates and consumption frequency. It will integrate Nuomis membership system with merchants own CRM systems through members-only prepaid cards, a payment after service offer, and through <i>BaiNuoLian</i>, a commission-based app for promotions. It plans to provide merchants with big data-driven tools for behavioral analytics, assisting merchants in making optimal decisions. The strategy will help merchants to acquire loyal users online, allowing them to tap into Baidus huge user base and driving large amounts of traffic to their sites or to their physical places of business.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Users who have reached certain spending levels automatically become VIP members, who then enjoy double discountsfrom Nuomi itself, and from the merchants member clubs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Baidu has been indexing the real world, and connecting people with services in the mobile era through its technology-based products and its ecosystem build-out, said Robin Li. Baidu Nuomi, as a platform that truly connects people with local life services, has been making great strides over the past year. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Going from connecting people with information to connecting people with services is a major transition, said Li. Such a transition requires determination, and it comes with costs. When weve determined to undertake something new, and it becomes the companys priority, we focus the whole companys attention into it. We dont just make promises: We deliver. And usually, we under promise, and over deliver, said Li.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Li emphasized that Baidus O2O strategy will fully leverage the companys strengths in technologyfrom voice and image recognition to Natural Language Processing to Big Data and Deep Learning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Zeng Liang, vice president at Baidu and general manager of Baidu Nuomi, said, Nuomis membership-based system drives customers to merchants, raises the quality of user experience, and helps create a healthy market ecosystem with merchants. These advantages are what differentiate Nuomi from the traditional group-buy platformswhich usually have fewer loyal users who tend to be very price-sensitive and are locked into a vicious circle of price competition that downgrades user experience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nuomi now operates in over 330 Chinese cities and aims to expand to cover all Chinese cities by the end of the year. It now boasts 650,000 online stores, with nearly 2 billion RMB in monthly turnover.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nuomi has been testing its Membership Plus strategy this year in two key categoriesrestaurants and movie ticketsby launching prepaid cards and membership cards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In trial operations, only four months after the launch of its prepaid card together with Nuomi, the famous Beijing Cantonese restaurant Lao Guang says that the cards brought in an additional million yuan in <a>turnover</a><a>[ys1]</a>&nbsp;. Traditional group buy can only bring us one-off customers, but Baidu Nuomis prepaid cards have helped us turn these one-time group buy customers into regulars. It is bringing us a large number of online members while helping us retain off-line customers. This is significantly improving the overall profitability of the restaurant, said Zhang Bin, general manager of Lao Guang restaurant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>During the recent May Day holiday, Baidu Nuomi introduced joint movie ticket membership cards with Dadi Digital Cinema, Stellar Mega, and 17.5. These membership cards sold out instantly. Zhao Jian, president of Stella Mega, said, Baidu Nuomis joint membership cards have brought new experiences to our online customers. In addition to helping us attract new members, its also allowed us to provide a customized viewing experience to them, based on their personal preferences. This has not only helped our cinemas to generate more revenue, but has enhanced our user loyalty and increased value-add consumption in theaters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gao Shuang, an analyst at the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), said she believes that the Membership Plus strategy pioneered by Baidu not only connects online and offline membership, but also helps business to increase profitability, enhance customer loyalty, pull in new customers, and improve retention rates. At the same time, it also provides users with greater freedom, convenience, and quality in service experience. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a truly collaborative platform for merchants and Baidu Nuomi, it stands out as an innovation in the O2O area. The 20 billion RMB investment over the next three years will bolster Nuomis advantage in overall resources, and will significantly alter the landscape and current market structure in the highly competitive O2O market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>About Baidu</b></p><p>Baidu, Inc. is the leading Chinese language Internet search provider.

The Peoples' Bank of China just shifted its official exchange rate for the second day running, effectively allowing&nbsp;the yuan to tumble by&nbsp;another 1.9% against the dollar, after a 1.9% cut on Tuesday.<br><br>Tuesday's cut was the biggest single move in a day, and together they take the Chinese currency back to where it was to the dollar in October 2012.<br><br>The&nbsp;PBOC has fixed the yuan at 6.3306 to the US dollar on Wednesday morning, weaker than where the spot price closed yesterday at 6.3250.<br><br>The yuan has weakened further  as of 7:25 a.m. London time (2:25 a.m. ET) it's at 6.444 against the dollar.<br><br>On Tuesday the PBOC fixed the USD/CNY at 6.2298, nearly 2% below the level seen on Monday following an unexpected currency devaluation.<br><br>Here's how it looks:<br><br>Over the longer term it's clear to see that China's currency has strengthened considerably against the dollar over the last decade.<br><br>The PBoC is trying to reverse some of that trend  in fact, the&nbsp;China is pretty much the only major trading partner of the United States whose currency hadn't&nbsp;already tumbled against the dollar in recent years:<br><br>Though the Shanghai Composite is pretty flat, down just 0.20% as of 7:30 a.m. London time (2:30 a.m. ET), other Asian markets are getting smoked.&nbsp;Japan's Nikkei&nbsp;is down 1.58% and&nbsp;Hong Kong's Hang Seng&nbsp;is down 2.11%.<br><br>European luxury exporters and premium car firms like LVMH and BMW got hammered yesterday too, a process that could resume again shortly.<br><br>A devaluation typically benefits a country's domestic producers, boosting their ability to export. That's because their goods are suddenly cheaper on international markets. A product that was worth 100 yuan two days ago is now effectively worth more like 96 yuan, if you're buying in dollars.<br><br>The opposite side of that is that it hurts anyone trying to export into China, since products denominated in other currencies are effectively getting more expensive.<br><br>The Chinese authorities are effectively trying to stimulate&nbsp;the economy, which has seen slowing growth in recent years. It remains to be seen just how much of a devaluation they're willing to engineer to achieve that goal.
<p><a href="http://www.socialcentiv.com/">SocialCentiv</a>, whose software-based service helps companies of all sizes find new customers on Twitter, announces a new feature that makes it easier and faster for a company to share its promotions and special offers with consumers.</p><p>SocialCentivs patented software uses a subscribers keywords and geographic location to comb Twitter for relevant Tweets, and drops them on a dashboard called the Tweet Stream so the business can @ direct reply with a coupon or discount to get them in the door.</p><p>The new multiple campaigns feature provides SocialCentiv clients a way to manage numerous discounts and other offers they may be using simultaneously to attract Twitter users who have expressed a need via the social networking platform for what the business sells.</p><p>As any good marketer knows, a business must use different types of promotions in different circumstances, such as price discounts, limited-time sales or product giveaways, says Bernard Perrine, CEO and co-founder of SocialCentiv. Extending multiple offers at the same time can be a challenge. Using keywords and geo-targeting, our multiple campaigns application makes that juggling act a snap.</p><p><b>Adding new campaigns</b></p><p>After logging in to SocialCentivs online service, customers will see a new tab in the navigation bar called Campaigns. By clicking that tab, followed by hitting a button marked Create a new campaign, they will receive the option of either building a new promotion or duplicating an existing one.</p><p></p><ul><li><b>Creating a new campaign</b>: This is the best route for building new offers that use unique keywords and locations. The SocialCentiv software guides users through such tasks as creating landing pages and follow-up emails and providing external links. After that, the user can pick the geographic locations to target consumers, along with keywords for filtering Tweets to find the right prospects.</li><li><b>Duplicating an existing campaign</b>: This is a good way to modify existing promotions for other uses or target groups. The Duplicate an existing campaign button includes the keywords and locations that were part of the original effort. From there, its simple to edit the promotion to suit the marketers needs. After the changes are made, SocialCentivs software asks the user to give the campaign a name.

Feel free to share this video and story on your social media or blog pages.</p><br><p>When Stephanie and Brett Parker discovered they were going to appear on the hit show, Shark Tank, they knew their lives would change, but they never imagined the experience would also change other lives as well. The Parkers are the founders of <a href="http://www.SleepingBaby.com">www.SleepingBaby.com</a> and inventors of the award-winning Zipadee-Zip sleep garment for children and infants. Their own amazing story of building a million-dollar brand from only $700 in savings caught the attention of Shark Tank producers and the Parkers were selected to appear on the premiere of the 2014/2015 Shark Tank season. When the Parkers were featured on Shark Tank, they shared the devastating loss of their own child and how their Sleeping Baby customers helped them heal in a unique way. To the Parkers surprise, they were flooded with support from around the globe, but an email from expecting mother, Kelly Blumenthal, stood out above the rest. </p><br><p>Kelly wrote Stephanie and conveyed how devastated she was when she discovered she was pregnant with a boy who had little to no chance at life due to potentially terminal heart defects. The Blumenthal family had to make plans to terminate the pregnancy based on the recommendation from doctors who conveyed the severity of the babys condition and his inevitable fate. However, after watching Stephanie share her heart and story of loss on Shark Tank, Kelly was renewed with a sense of purpose and drive to see her little one survive and gave him a chance at life.</p><br><p>Kelly wrote, I saw you on Shark Tank and all of a sudden, I was just filled with strength, validation and purpose. Hearing you and seeing you say it right in front of me made my heart stop. What am I doing?! I am going to full term with Finn because I believe in him and I believe there is a higher power and a bigger reason for all of this. I need to have more faith and stop being scared. I WILL enjoy this pregnancy and the time I have with Finn. I will be braver by loving with reckless abandonment. Knowing what may or may not happen does not change how much love I have for him. THANK YOU for bringing me peace and for reminding me to cherish and love and to not be scared because everything truly DOES happen for a reason."</p><br><p><img width="300" alt="kelly1png" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/121188/kelly1-png" height="306"></p><br><p>Stephanie shared Kellys story on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Zipadeezip-Slumber-Sacks-wwwzipadeezipcom/140978145992706?fref=ts" target="_blank">Zipadee-Zip Facebook page</a>&nbsp;and their Sleeping Baby fans surrounded the family in an overwhelming supply of prayers and support during the pregnancy. The result was nothing short of miraculous. Baby Finn was born on January 2nd 2015. Finn means 'little warrior' and, true to his name, he began to fight! Finn has had a heart surgery and multiple other surgeries but he continues to improve and has truly beaten all odds and is alive and well and recently headed home from the hospital! He is full of life and happiness and has affected more lives than anyone ever thought possible. Kelly made the most of her time in the hospital with Finn and went out of her way to help the families in the hospital and in her community that are going through similar struggles. &nbsp;</p><br><p>During Finns extended hospital stay, the Parkers frequently heard about how grateful the Blumenthals were for the support they received from the Ronald McDonald House. The Ronald McDonald House (RMH) makes it possible for families like Finns to stay close to their little ones during some of the most difficult days of their little lives. Inspired by Finns strength and the incredible support that the RMH was to the family, Stephanie Parker, creator of the Zipadee-Zip, designed the Finn print to help raise money for this amazing organization and family! Ten percent of sales will go to help support the RMH and one dollar from each sale will also go to help pay the Blumenthal familys mounting hospital bills! The Finn Zipadee-Zip and the Finn Flying Squirrel Toddler PJ will also be available to purchase for donation. Kelly will personally deliver any donated item to families in need. &nbsp;</p><br><p>Stephanie Parker recently paid a surprise visit to baby Finn in the hospital to deliver the very first Finn Zipadee-Zip and Flying Squirrel PJ in person! The Blumenthals couldnt have been more thrilled to finally meet each other in person for the first time!</p><br><p><img width="400" alt="image1png" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/121188/image1-png" height="266" title="Image: http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/121188/image1-png"></p><br><p>Our Sleeping Baby business is so much bigger than just the Zipadee-Zip, says Stephanie, who marvels at how their little sleep invention has done so much more than improve sleep. </p><br><p>This is what its all about, she says, helping families in a big picture kind of way! We feel like this business has been such an incredible gift from God and it is a great honor to be able to help others however we can! I hope people are inspired by this story to focus on the incredible amount of light that can come as a result of lifes darkest moments. I would encourage people to not be afraid of sharing their struggles because you never know who it might impact.</p><br><p><img width="192" alt="finn1png" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/121188/finn1-png" height="275">&nbsp; &nbsp;<img width="183" alt="finn2png" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/121188/finn2-png" height="275">&nbsp; &nbsp;<img width="207" alt="finn3png" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/121188/finn3-png" height="275"></p><br><p>Order the Limited Edition Finn Zipadee-Zip for the Ronald McDonald House Charities here (SIZES 3M-24M): &nbsp;<a href="http://www.sleepingbaby.com/products/the-finn-zipadee-zip" target="_blank">http://www.sleepingbaby.com/products/the-finn-zipadee-zip</a>&nbsp;</p><br><p>Order the Limited Edition Finn Flying Squirrel PJ for the Ronald McDonald House Charities here (SIZES 24M-5T):&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sleepingbaby.com/products/the-finn-flying-squirrel" target="_blank">http://www.sleepingbaby.com/products/the-finn-flying-squirrel</a></p><br><p>For more information and to keep updated on Finns progress visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/prayersforbabyfinn" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/prayersforbabyfinn</a>.</p><br><p>Note to the media:&nbsp;To schedule an interview with Stephanie and Brett, contact Giselle Diaz at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:%20pr@sleepingbaby.com" target="_blank">pr@sleepingbaby.com</a>&nbsp;and CC Stephanie at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Stephanie@sleepingbaby.com" target="_blank">Stephanie@sleepingbaby.com</a>&nbsp;or call 914-325-9786.</p><br><p>###</p><div><br></div></div>

The company was founded by Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg, who fled to New York after the European revolutions of 1848-9. Having once built a piano in his kitchen, he and his sons worked in American piano factories, understanding each part in detail before combining their skills to make pianos of intense technical refinement. On March 5 1853, having already completed 482 models, Steinway &amp; Sons was founded.</p><p>A Hamburg factory was opened in 1880 to cope with the European demand for what became renowned as the best concert piano, without the cost of shipping them from New York. The two factories still duplicate manufacturing processes, following what are now 127 patents.</p><p>We still make every piano from outside to inside, Höpermann says. The process starts with the choice of timbers: spruce, maple and mahogany. Thickly sawn boards are stacked for a couple of years to allow them to dehumidify, and then sent to a trockenkammer  a drying room  to bake at 70C for up to four weeks, reducing their humidity to 6 per cent. The stabilised slabs of maple and mahogany are then wheeled into a resin-scented workshop to be cut into thin sheets and glued as veneered plywood. Mahogany is used on the faces and centre (rarer woods feature on the finest editions), layers of maple set between, to a thickness of a few inches. This wet, ligneous sandwich, perhaps 10ft to 15ft long  and 1.5ft in width  is bent and clamped in the shape of a great harp, which will be a grand pianos outer case called the rim, in length between 155cm and 274cm, according to the model. Though the rim will have dried in just a few hours, the glue reintroduces humidity to the wood, which needs clamping and controlled storage for 100 days.</p><div><img alt="Heinrich Steinweg who founded the Steinway company in 1853" src="http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/94242b5e-2b60-11e5-8613-e7aedbb7bdb7.img">©Steinway &amp; Sons<p>Heinrich Steinweg, who founded the company in 1853</p></div><p>Then a spruce frame braces the base of the rim and supports the wooden soundboard, which will resonate beneath the strings. The rigorous process of timber selection has by now eliminated 55 per cent of the mahogany and maple and 80 per cent of the spruce, all of which gets pulped for Steinways unusually fragrant eco-boiler.</p><p>The rim is now a case. Even before being sprayed with black polyester resin buffed to a mirror finish 0.5mm thick, it receives a cast-iron frame, which has the job of bracing 20 tonnes of tension from all the tightened strings. The frame is made by OS Kelly, an American foundry owned by Steinway. It arrives roughly finished awaiting smoothing and spray-painting in deep gold, with hand-finished lettering.</p><p>The strings are made in-house by Damien Kolanck, 17 years a string-maker. It was my dream always, to work for Steinway, he says. His workshop is stacked with rolls of steel and copper wires, which he winds into coils with precision. How much string do you make a year? I ask. He frowns, not having made the calculation. It turns out to be 80km (49 miles), which the factorys annual output of 1,400 pianos gobbles up.</p><div><ul><li><img width="600" alt="Steinway piano soundboard" src="http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/bdc0e63a-d664-4eea-a6f7-4d06bbc732dc.img" height="338" title="Image: http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/bdc0e63a-d664-4eea-a6f7-4d06bbc732dc.img"><div>Inside a Steinway piano<div>©Steinway &amp; Sons</div></div></li><li><img alt="making a Steinway piano" src="http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/de8dc613-f114-418e-8b96-95b32686a523.img" title="Image httpimft-staticcomcontentimagesde8dc613-f114-418e-8b96-95b32686a523img"><div>Most of the tasks that go into making a piano are still done by hand<div>©Steinway &amp; Sons</div></div></li><li><div>Shaping tools for the pianos<div>©Steinway &amp; Sons</div></div></li><li><div>Shaping tools, many of which have not changed for decades<div>©Steinway &amp; Sons</div></div></li><li><div>Individual pieces are glued by hand<div>©Steinway &amp; Sons</div></div></li><li><div>Craftsmen at the Hamburg factory fit the rim, made of up to 20 solid, hardwood layers<div>©Steinway &amp; Sons</div></div></li><li><div>Chief voicer Wiebke Wunstorf fine-tuning a Steinway before it leaves the factory<div>©Steinway &amp; Sons</div></div></li><li><div>Heinrich Steinweg, who founded the company in 1853<div>©Steinway &amp; Sons</div></div></li><li><div>Russian composer and pianist Sergei Rachmaninov with his granddaughter, in a postcard he sent to the company to thank them for his piano<div>©Steinway &amp; Sons</div></div></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><img width="114" alt="" src="http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/c0046d8a-f478-4699-bc0f-6b27c5537aff.img" height="64"><div></div></li><li><img width="114" alt="" src="http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/c689c158-f399-4c8f-b4ea-e2398fa33f29.img" height="64"></li><li><img width="114" alt="" src="http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/35a0283f-10ec-4b06-8700-80f5cb64e7c7.img" height="64"></li><li><img width="114" alt="" src="http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/8c0328bb-cf3b-44c7-973a-05d4c258639b.img" height="64"></li><li><img width="114" alt="" src="http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/c243860a-a484-4d6a-bd43-394da6f0a503.img" height="64"></li><li><img width="114" alt="" src="http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/def88032-18bd-4ee6-89ba-8437825e142f.img" height="64"></li><li><img width="114" alt="" src="http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/dd4d027f-1427-4386-9dbf-b10420b2fe98.img" height="64"></li><li><img width="114" alt="" src="http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/866f9f86-85e2-49dd-9321-4c5703d29a8f.img" height="64"></li><li><img width="114" alt="" src="http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/bfbc137f-bc41-4992-b94d-afcb0688d6d9.img" height="64"></li></ul><div>Next Thumbnails</div></div><p>Next, the keyboard is assembled. Sanna Rastas is one of half a dozen keyboard regulators. She came to Hamburg from Finland for a three-year apprenticeship at Steinway, learning how to adjust the complex mechanism of 88 keys, each with a wooden arm to lever up the felt-clad hammers that strike the strings with a subtle responsiveness. She weighs each, and adjusts them as necessary, using a mirror to see inside the mechanism. Sometimes a small flame is waved under the levers to make adjustments in the wood cells. Each key affects the next  getting the balance right takes three days. Given this understanding of the instrument, I presume she must play the piano.</p><p>No, I dont. But I will one day.</p><div>A&nbsp;Steinway is so well-made that, we know when a customer picks one, we will never see them&nbsp;again<div><a>Tweet&nbsp;this quote</a></div></div><p>Its a response I hear many times. Höpermann tells me she doesnt need to play to appreciate the piano as an object. In this quasi-monastic factory every artisan knows their role, with a log book proudly signed for each completed step of the process. And if few play the piano, the staff all revere their instruments. They are bound for the worlds great concert halls, into the hands of the finest interpreters who will embolden, intrigue and break the hearts of audiences in their thousands.</p><p>Different pianos suit the style of different players. Here, we reach the stage of tuning and finding character, two different things. The latter is the job of Wiebke Wunstorf, chief voicer.</p><p>Every instrument has tones that are not right, she says. Listen. She presses three keys  one has the faintest rasp. Its sharp. She pulls out the keyboard and jabs a three-pronged hand-tool into a felt hammer to loosen the fabric, and slides the keyboard back in. No, still off. And again she jabs and smoothes. Perfect. The words she chooses to describe what she seeks are clear, powerful, long notes, so that the piano should sing, with a variety of colour. But no one knows exactly what I mean by this. No machine can replicate her ear, which optimises the distinctive character that is innate in every piano.</p><div><img alt="making a Steinway piano" src="http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/af1c851e-2b60-11e5-8613-e7aedbb7bdb7.img" title="Image httpimft-staticcomcontentimagesaf1c851e-2b60-11e5-8613-e7aedbb7bdb7img">©Steinway &amp; Sons<p>Individual pieces are glued by hand</p></div><p>Since being the first female apprentice, Wunstorf has been at Steinway for 36 years. This dedication is not unusual. In 2014, 425 staff had served 25 years; 85 had worked for 40 years. One has stuck with Steinway for 60 years.</p><p>Throughout this production line of amazing crafts, I hadnt heard about customer service. Presumably maintenance is an issue? Höpermann shrugs. Of course, everything needs to be looked after. But a Steinway is so well made, we know that when a customer has chosen their piano from our saleroom, well never see them again.</p><h2>Noteworthy milestone</h2><p>Steinway &amp; Sons unveiled the companys 600,000th piano, The Fibonacci, at Masterpiece London on June 24 2015.

It will be a prestigious addition to the previous milestone models: the 100,000th Steinway &amp; Sons piano is part of the permanent collection at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, while the 300,000th piano resides in the White Houses East Room.</p><p>Photographs: Steinway &amp; Sons</p></div></div>
Jeffrey Biegel is one of the busiest and most versatile pianists around. A Steinway Artist, he is both fiery champion of the classical repertoire and top pick among today's classical composers to debut their work. Jeffrey also maintains an active recording schedule -- three albums are being released this summer. The creation stories behind the recordings suggest the force of Destiny. For sure, one of them includes the intervention of an honest-to-God angel. The first album debuted last week -- Symphonic Arrangement: Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano. "I've loved Claude Bolling's suite my whole life," said Jeffrey. "I've also had this crazy idea that it would sound great with orchestra." Enter composer/arranger Steve Barta.<br>Jeffrey Biegel. Courtesy of the artistIn 2008, I was playing with the Colorado Springs Philharmonic and got together with Steve Barta. I mentioned my idea about adding orchestra to Bolling's Suite. Steve has had the same idea since long back. 'You're the jazz guy,' I said, 'why don't you do it?' He agreed. There was no commissioning fee, nothing. But we had to get Claude Bolling's permission. 'Do what you want,' he replied, 'but do not change the original score. The suite has been played around with before. Don't do anything but the original. But you can add to it.' So, that's what Steve did. He also single handedly raised all the money to get the project done.Renowned flutist Hubert Laws was secured for the recording, also Brazilian drummer Michael Shapiro and bassist Mike Valerio. Illustrator Roger Huyssen -- whose cover for the 1975 LP is itself a collector's item -- tweaked his original design into an intriguing new vision. The original recording pairs Claude Bolling on piano with flutist Jean-Pierre Rampal. It is pure magic. It stayed on Billboard's Top 40 charts for nearly ten years.<br>Covers for 1975 and 2015 LP and CD. Courtesy of the artist.Back then the idea was to just make it a jazz combo piece. It's like what Vince Guaraldi was doing all those years with the 'Peanuts' music - it was a small group. Most of the jazz that was written was not with symphony orchestra. It was small ensembles. The only jazz that was really written with symphony orchestra was Gershwin's Concerto in F. Also, Duke Ellington had a small orchestra for his New World a-Comin', then came Copland's Clarinet Concerto, and Lalo Schifrin's Piano Concerto no. 2 -- a huge jazz concerto. There wasn't a lot of symphonic jazz with soloist. Bolling's was a combo piece -- a suite for flute and jazz piano with a drummer and a bass. That's all he needed. It took all these years until Steve and I were eye-to-eye and shared a common idea that gave it birth. Luckily, Bolling said, 'Sure, go for it.' What's great is that it's going to be available as a vinyl LP, a CD and digital download. Not only are people excited about the recording and the premiere, but there is interest among the flutists in the world to play it. I will do the world premiere in November with the South Shore Symphony on Long Island. The conductor is Scott Jackson Wiley and they're bringing in Hubert Laws. My son Evan is a member of the orchestra in the percussion section.<br>Courtesy of Entertainment One Music/ENTOn August 7, eOne Music will release Volume 2 of Mozart: The Complete Sonatas For Piano. It has been sitting in the queue for the past five years, the entire body of work having been recorded before 2010. Volume 1 was released in 2009 on the Koch label -- which was then bought out by eOne Music, a primary division of Entertainment One. Susan Napodano DelGiorno produced the entire set of recordings. Susan and Jeffrey collaborated on his 2007 solo album, Classical Carols -- 21 tracks of familiar Christmas carols exquisitely arranged by Carolyne Taylor. For the Mozart project -- a prime component in Jeffrey's m.o. was to pump new life into the repeats, some of which the composer had not written out. Jeffrey already knew he could rely on Susan's discerning ear -- not only for the structure of his ornamentations, but for pace and continuity.Susan has impeccable taste. She knows what's going to sound well to the listener. When you're in the recording studio, part of you thinks, 'This is going to be forever --&nbsp;after I'm long gone.' You want the recording to be a certain way. So, you're really putting your trust in the hands of the producer and the engineer. You want them to listen with the same ears as you -- before you play a note. You want them to hear and feel what you're doing, to play along with you. If there is something you intended to do, but it didn't quite come out that way -- they will be sensitive to that. That is a really great engineer or producer. I want the listener to feel that the ornamentation I've added in the repeats is a result of what the music says to me, rather than just me adding ribbons and bows to what is already there. Throughout the entire recording process, I kept coming back to a quote from my teacher, Adele Marcus -- 'Don't do anything to the music. Let the music do something to you.' The thing I'm most careful about is not to allow any recording to become so sterile and so clean to the point that it lacks emotional adrenalin.<br>Jeffrey Biegel and Lucas Richman. Courtesy of the artistsOn September 1, Albany Records releases Lucas Richman's Concerto for Piano and Orchestra: In Truth. Richman leads the Pittsburgh Symphony in this sumptuous work dedicated to Jeffrey Biegel. The concerto was first presented by the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra in October 2013 during Lucas Richman's tenure as Musical Director and with Jeffrey at the piano. The adventure of it all borders on the stuff of a medieval Miracle Play. Lucas wanted to write a piano concerto for me. He said, 'Probably for the first time in your life, you won't have to raise the money for the commission. I want to write it.' I looked at him and said, 'God bless you! It's the first time anybody ever said that to me.' He decided he would write this concerto and whatever he could get as a grant, he got. It was very minimal. This was a labor of love.The three movements of Richman's concerto, In Truth, are titled: To One's Self, To One's World, To One's Spirit. Using a musical cryptogram -- taking the notes of the scale (A-G) and assigning them to the letters of the alphabet (r = D, x = C) -- the composer formed melodic lines based on the word Truth (F D G F A ) and it's Hebrew equivalent, Emet (E F E F). The words -- now a series of memorable notes -- were then coupled, separated, reversed, turned up one side and twisted down the other. All the while, Richman remains grounded in two sacred texts:"Strengthen the bond between your inner feeling and The One who watches over you."<br>"The Lord is near to all who called him -- to all who called him in truth."The end result is a sweeping work that is cinematic in scope, its three movements transcending into a guided uber meditation, with the pianist standing-in for us all -- confessing, in truth. It's like being in front of the burning bush. The radiance is awesome, you are compelled to surrender.A few weeks after the premier in Knoxville, Lucas calls me. 'You're not going to believe this. Someone from the audience approached me and said -- You have to record that concerto.' Lucas tells him he would love to, but it's very expensive to make a recording. How much? Like, a hundred thousand dollars? And the guy says -- OK.' Lucas then tells me we'll be recording it with the Pittsburgh Symphony. That was the payback for his writing such a brilliantly beautiful new concerto. Lucas didn't do it for what he might get paid. He did it because he wanted to.The recording is a live concert. It was a special added concert, free to subscribers and donors. We rehearsed, had a dress rehearsal, then the performance. The engineers were only allowed to use material from the dress rehearsal and the performance. Then a patch session after and I recorded the cadenza separately without the orchestra. I couldn't be happier. Albany Records has wonderful engineers -- Elizabeth Ostrow and The Sound/Mirror recording team -- top recording engineers in the country. Liz did a beautiful job of editing. It sounds like a million bucks.<br>Lucas Richman and Jeffrey Biegel. Courtesy of the artists.Click here to stay in touch: Jeffrey Biegel
Shen Lu invokes water imagery throughout these selections from his recital program blending Chinese folk music with more traditional classical fare by Ravel and Rachmaninov and ending with Tan Duns ode to his childhood in Hunan, Eight Memories in Watercolor<br><br>Distinguished pianist and 2014 Hilton Head International Piano Competition jurist John OConor, declared that gold prize winner "Shen Lus interpretations have great depth, his technique seems effortless, and he communicates wonderfully with his audience." Shens prize includes this collaboration with Steinway &amp; Sons  a debut recording from an exceptional young artist. The Steinway &amp; Sons label releases Shen Lus Watercolor on August 11, 2015.<br><br>Based on Shens award-winning recital program, water imagery flows throughout the albums selections. Watercolor opens with Chen Peixuns arrangement of a 1930s Chinese folk song Autumn Moon on a Calm Lake (Lü Wencheng); a gentle melody driven downstream through the constant movement of broken arpeggios working in concert with rippling textures. The calmness is broken by Maurice Ravels masterwork Miroirs with its five movements each dedicated to a fellow member of the French avant-garde artist group, Les Apaches.<br><br>The eight pieces of Rachmaninovs Etudes Tableaux, Op. 33, among the last pieces written in the composer-soloist tradition, are a study in musical moods  "picture studies" of the highest order, running the gamut of human expression and serving as musical evocations of external visual stimuli.<br><br> <br><br> The album concludes with Hunan-born Tan Duns Eight Memories in Watercolor, conceived by the composer when he left Hunan to study at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing. Homesick and longing to savor the folk songs and memories of his childhood in the era of Chinas burgeoning Cultural Revolution, this first solo piano work by Tan Dun presents a diary of longing and features four of his favorite childhood folk songs.<br><br>A native of Jiangsu, China, Shen Lu has performed concerts at Beijings Central Conservatory Music Hall, Weill Recital Hall and Carnegie Hall in New York, Jordan Hall in Boston, Severance Hall in Cleveland, The Kennedy Center in Washington DC, The County Museum of Art in Los Angeles, the Seymour Centre in Sydney, and the National Concert Hall in Dublin. He was a prize-winner at the 59th Wideman, the 4th Campillos, the 2nd Florida, and the 25th Ferrol International Piano Competitions, and won best French music prize for Ravels Miroirs at the 2015 Dublin International Piano Competition. He earned his Bachelors Degree at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing under Wu Ying, and his Masters and Graduate Diploma from the New England Conservatory in Boston under Alexander Korsantia. Mr. Shens other teachers included Li Siying, Huang Tiandong, Chen Zihua, and his father Shen Guofu.

Renowned Designer Frank Pollaro Creates "The Fibonacci," A Masterpiece That Celebrates The Art of Handcraftsmanship<br><br>Steinway &amp; Sons, manufacturer of the worlds finest pianos, today unveiled the companys 600,000th piano, stunningly designed by master artisan, Frank Pollaro. Handcrafted using natural Macassar ebony, the end result is a feat of artistry, engineering and precision that celebrates this milestone for Steinway &amp; Sons and demonstrates the companys ongoing commitment to uncompromising craftsmanship.<br><br>Named "The Fibonacci," the pianos veneer features the iconic Fibonacci spiral made entirely from six individual logs of Macassar Ebony, creating a fluid design that represents the geometric harmony found in nature. The lines of The Fibonacci spiral on the top of the pianos lid are projected down to its unique curved base. Synthetic ivory inlay adds a breathtaking effect to the design, which also features unique patinated bronze details. In the end, over 6,000 hours of work over a four-year period were devoted to the creation of The Fibonacci, from design to finish. The superior craftsmanship of the pianos exterior is matched only by the unparalleled craftsmanship that is at the very core of all Steinway &amp; Sons pianos.<br><br>According to Frank Pollaro, "Designing Steinway &amp; Sons 600,000th piano was an honor and a challenge. To me, knowing that this piano would become part of history meant that it had to be more than just a beautiful design, but also needed to visually convey a deeper message." Pollaro added, "As I considered the number 600,000, the Fibonacci spiral came to mind. The way in which it continues to grow but stay true to its form is very much like Steinway &amp; Sons over these many years. Combining the universal languages of music and mathematics suddenly made perfect sense."<br><br>"Steinway &amp; Sons has a long tradition of world-class craftsmanship, so as we began planning the 600,000th piano, it quickly became apparent that Frank Pollaro was the artist we needed for creative design and perfect execution. His ability to create unforgettable images through woodwork demonstrates artistry at the highest level, something that spoke to the very core of what this company is all about," stated Darren Marshall, Chief Marketing Officer of Steinway &amp; Sons. Adding, "The Fibonacci spiral is a representation of perfect proportions and natural beauty. Without a doubt, Frank captured those qualities in this piano, creating a work of art for the eyes and the ears."<br><br>The Fibonacci is destined to become an important piece of cultural history, taking its place of honor amongst previous milestone models that the company has created. The 100,000th was originally given to the United States White House and is now part of the permanent collection at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington D.C., while the 300,000 piano currently resides in the East Room of the White House.<br><br>In April The Fibonacci was previewed during a special VIP reception at Steinway &amp; Sons new showroom in Beverly Hills, where the internationally celebrated Steinway Artist, Lang Lang, had the honor of being the first artist to perform on the piano. This June The Fibonacci will travel to the United Kingdom, where it will be showcased at the 2015 Masterpiece London art fair.<br><br>The Fibonacci is a Steinway &amp; Sons Model D piano, nine foot concert grand, priced at $2.4 million. In addition to the original 600,000th version, Steinway &amp; Sons will create up to six exclusive, limited edition Model B pianos (610.5") inspired by the same design.<br><br>For more information about The Fibonacci, please contact Laura Seele at +1 (646)356-3960<br><br>About Frank Pollaro<br><br> As a young man, Frank Pollaro became interested in the master works of furniture designer Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann. He fell in love with the way Ruhlmann used ivory as an embellishment against rich, dark wood backgrounds. Fascinated by the natural colors and textures of exotic woods, he began to collect solid wood and veneer from all corners of the world, a passion that he has continued for more than 30 years. His collection currently contains over 80 species and the largest collection of rare woods in private hands.<br><br>Twenty-seven years after founding Pollaro Custom Furniture, Franks work continues to win critical acclaim from leading collectors, designers and architects, who consider a Pollaro piece to be the crown jewel of their interiors.

Many organizers asked me&nbsp;how we built an engaging startup community at CoInvent. The answer can always be simplified and broken down to two parts  people (team) and technology. In this post, Im going to focus on the latter part  technology  a.k.a. social platforms or content management tools. If you have attended a CoInvent event in the past, you either registered on Meetup or Eventbrite. In addition, Mailchimp is our choice for sending newsletter and group email messages. So&nbsp;I will&nbsp;focus on the pros and cons of each of these platforms below.<br><br>According to Meetup.com, Meetup is the worlds largest network of local groups. Meetup makes it easy for anyone to organize a local group or find one of the thousands already meeting up face-to-face.<br><br>The CoInvent concept was practically founded as a small Meetup group in May, 2009. Over the past 6 years, we were able to build&nbsp;one of the largest startup/entrepreneur Meetup groups in the world.<br><br>Meetup.com is&nbsp;one of the original event management software tools. It revolutionized the way people organize events. It enables organizers to create groups and host events based on specific interests and hobbies. Every group on Meetup is closely connected to each other. Members can join as many groups as they wish. If&nbsp;people talk about your events positively, your Meetup group can grow real fast. Meetups ecosystem is well developed in big cities&nbsp;and metropolitan areas.<br><br>1). Meetup.com doesnt disclose members email info to group organizers even though they belong to their groups. And there is no way for&nbsp;organizers to collect that info either<br><br>2). Meetup&nbsp;groups are&nbsp;good for organizing local events as in one particular region or area. If you have a New York group but want to hold an event in Boston, you have no choice but have to start another&nbsp;Meetup group<br><br>3). Meetup can also be considered as a ticketing platform. Sadly, it doesnt let organizers add multiple tickets with different tiers of pricing<br><br>4). Although Meetup has been around for more than 10 years, its not uncommon for you to see the fail-whale sign from time to time. I vividly remember that Meetup suffered a DDoS attack on March 2nd, 2013, and had a hard time staying up for an entire week. For organizers who solely rely on the Meetup platform to host events, its really bad news if one of their events experiences&nbsp;these downtimes too<br><br>5). There isnt a way to turn off the comment feature for Meetup events. When someone posts a comment, it automatically gets delivered to every attendees email inbox. I think Meetup should make the comment feature optional in the future so organizers can turn it off for the group if they deem it necessary. Personally, Id much prefer to have a conversation with our group members on Twitter or our Facebook page<br><br>Eventbrite is a global marketplace for live experiences that allows people to find and create events.<br><br>We integrate the Eventbrite platform to the CoInvent website. Its considered the official registration tool for our non-Meetup crowd.<br><br>Eventbrite seems to be the perfect choice for event organizers these days. It seems to understand the business its in and doesnt have a lot of distractions other than its ticketing features. For me, what makes Eventbrite unique and useful is its ability to integrate with our own website and the fact that event hosts can put out several types of tickets at the same time.<br><br>Compared to Meetup.com, Eventbrite doesnt have the community aspect. But you can also consider that as a pro if you prefer its simplicity. Also at this moment, it seems that Eventbrite is very heavy on business and tech events. Not many sports and concert events can be found there.<br><br>MailChimp is an email marketing service for users to send email newsletters, manage subscriber lists, and track campaign performance.<br><br>We use Mailchimp to send our newsletter, local event alerts, and special announcements almost every week. All our non-Meetup contacts are stored in our Mailchimp database. Without Mailchimp, we wouldnt be able to communicate with our subscribers and most of our members.<br><br>1). Mailchimp has clear guidelines on how to conduct email marketing. Make sure all your contacts are opt-in emails. Otherwise, your newsletters or messages can be easily flagged&nbsp;as spam. This killer feature leaves no room for spammers<br><br>2). The data analytics tool that Mailchimp provides gives marketers all types of real-time metrics  open rates, click rates, subscriber demographics, click map, bounce rates, opt-out rates, etc. This in turn helps campaigners get a better understanding of their audience<br><br>3). Mailchimp lets you add an opt-in form to your website or link it to an url. This is a great branding feature. For example, CoInvents newsletter subscription link is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.GetCoInvent.com">www.GetCoInvent.com</a><br><br>1). Mailchimp can get pretty&nbsp;expensive once you reach a critical mass&nbsp;for your subscribers  usually start with 30,000 subscribers.

Uber isnt happy with&nbsp;its competitors in China. The U.S. ride-sharing Goliath has spoken out for the first time about being blocked on WeChat, Chinas hugely popular mobile messaging platform&nbsp;which is run by Tencent, an investor in Uber rival Didi Kuaidi.<br><br>Emil Michael, the Uber exec who found himself in hot water after making comments about journalists last year, lamented the freezing of Ubers WeChat account to Bloomberg. Uber had a range of accounts set up on WeChat  which is arguably more&nbsp;important for customer relations in China than&nbsp;a Facebook Page is in the West&nbsp; but things began to change following&nbsp;the billion dollar merger between Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache in February.<br><br>From then on is when you start to see a deterioration in the competitive environment, and it hit a crescendo where our [WeChat] accounts actually got shut off in March, Michael said to Bloomberg.<br><br>We contacted Uber and Tencent for comment, but neither company provided a response. (Well update if and when they do.)<br><br>The first sign of a block&nbsp;did indeed come in March of this year, when Ubers official account was removed, apparently due to&nbsp;violating rules.&nbsp;WeChat then reportedly scrubbed out all mentions&nbsp;of Uber from the services search feature&nbsp;in July to further hide the service from users. Couple this&nbsp;with a recent investment in Didi Kuaidi from Chinas sovereign wealth fund, and you have all the ingredients for Tech Outrage.<br><br>Even though Uber claims over a million rides per day in China, which it said will overtake its U.S. business, the company believes the WeChat block is curtailing its potential.&nbsp;Its easy to see how this situation frustrates Uber  which, by the way, is currently raising funding for its China business; Bloomberg said Michael is leading that charge  since WeChat has such a huge following in China, where the majority of its 500 million-plus active users are thought to be based.<br><br>But lets not feign surprise. This is life on the internet, and life in China.<br><br>Tencent uses WeChat to further a lot of its goals. For example, JD.com  the rival to Alibaba that Tencent invested in  is integrated with the service to allow WeChat users to place orders from inside the app. Didi Dache and Kuaidi Daches services&nbsp;still exist separately despite the merger, and the former is also baked into WeChat so you can order a taxi in seconds without ever leaving the app.<br><br>Tencent has also, to its credit, added lots of other utility and convenience-centric services to WeChat, so you can pay your bills and do other daily tasks more easily. But, on the business side,&nbsp;its&nbsp;investors would be concerned if the service was managed in such a way that rivals were profiting from it at their own expense.<br><br>Uber should know better. When you use someone elses platform, youre subject to their rules and, at times, their decisions.<br><br>It wasnt so long ago that Facebook would cut access to its platform for a range of social services that competed with it some way, shape or form. Heck, Twitter stills does it,&nbsp;as the team at Meerkat, a rival to Twitters Periscope live-streaming app, can attest to.<br><br>What makes Uber feel this situation is so different?<br><br>Maybe, as I wrote last year, its the arrogance that comes with being a $40 billion company frequently referred to as disruptive.<br><br>Uber is used to knocking down barriers as part of its&nbsp;determined push to change the world (using its vision of whats best)  but all too often that rampant enthusiasm manifests itself in ugly scenarios, such as Michaels comments about media, the tracking of users and other things that bubbled up last year when I argued&nbsp;that the companys moral compass was corrupted and in need of a reset.<br><br>In this case, Uber isnt harming anyone, but it looks foolish and desperate and perhaps even&nbsp;hypercritical, too.<br><br>Uber has its own power relationship in China, courtesy of search giant Baidu which made a strategic investment in the U.S. firm&nbsp;in early 2015.<br><br>One of the fruits of that coming-together is that Uber is the taxi-app of choice in Baidu Maps, Chinas largest consumer maps app, while Uber enjoys prime positioning within other Baidu services, which include Chinas top search engine.<br><br>The maps arrangement is&nbsp;similar to that which Uber enjoys with Google in the West  is that really all that different to Tencents position on WeChat?<br><br>Either way, Michael said he believes that Tencent will change its tune once it becomes apparent that Uber isnt going anywhere.<br><br>I think as we continue to succeed, and its clear were in this for the long haul  weve got Chinese investors behind us; weve got partnerships with cities; were spending money in the local economy; local investors have an interest in our success  then well get into more of a détente mode,&nbsp;he told Bloomberg.<br><br>Good luck. Tencents WeChat-related feuds&nbsp;with rivals like Alibaba, Qihoo 360 and others have never entered détente mode.<br><br>Beyond the issues at hand, Michaels comments&nbsp;falsely paint Uber as a total outsider in China. Thats convenient in this case, where things dont suit, but it does a disservice to the companys localization efforts which  despite some arguments&nbsp;otherwise&nbsp; are actually impressive in China and across Asia. Yes, Uber is an American company, but it has adapted to local markets in a far better manner than the latest running of Emil Michaels mouth would have you believe.

<p>College and professional football teams kick off their seasons in September. But for some sports marketers, its already four-down territory. The Hail Mary? Twitter marketing software <a href="http://www.socialcentiv.com/">SocialCentiv</a>. The platform works to keep teams connected digitally to their fans in order to engage them with special discounts and deals at the moment those fans are ready to buy.</p><p>SocialCentivs patented technology, which provides a software-based lead generation and revenue traction service that helps companies find new customers on Twitter, announces that it has achieved an 80-percent growth rate in its sports marketing business, helping clients with tickets and merchandise sales, and sweepstakes entries. In fact, SocialCentivs CPC, or cost-per-click as its known in the industry, for some sporting events clients is under $1.</p><p>By one <a href="http://www.dailyinfographic.com/sports-social-media-infographic">measure</a>, 83 percent of fans check social media while watching games on television, and 63 percent check updates while at the stadium, says Bernard Perrine, co-founder and CEO of SocialCentiv. A third of all people have used social media for sports information during meetings at work. Another nine percent have even taken a glance at the score during church.</p><p>Unfortunately, many sports marketers still lack proven methods for mining social media for revenue, Perrine noted. If that group fails to get help, they are looking at third down and forever.</p><p>Industry analysts agree that online marketing is huge for sports and how efforts in those areas impact fans buying habits. On average in the U.S., 25  35 percent of tickets to professional sporting events routinely go unsold. Whats sadder is that 30 percent of the fans who would fill those seats would have gone if they had been aware of the event. (<a href="http://www.sloansportsconference.com/?p=16049">sloansportsconverence.com</a>)<br></p><p>SocialCentiv tackles the problem by mining Twitter for words and phrases that sports fans frequently use in Tweets, such as we need a win. The client can then @ respond directly with an offer of discounted products or services, such as @Twitteruser who wants a win, why dont you cheer us on in person! Heres a coupon for 20 percent off your seats for the next home game!<br></p><p>Wondering how much fans Tweet about their teams?</p><p>·  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Nearly 5 million fans Tweeted about their favorite teams during the 2014 Nation Football League season.</p><p>·  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Nearly 5 million Tweets went out from fans to their teams during the 2015 Major League Baseball season.</p><p>·  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  More than 10 million fans Tweeted about their favorite National Basketball Association team during the 2015 season.</p><p>      </p><p>·  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Nearly 5 million fans Tweeted about their favorite teams during the 2014 National Hockey League season.</p><p>Each of those is a captured lead, representing a fan who is thinking about sports and might be motivated to buy tickets, or a team cap or shirt, or enter a sweepstakes. SocialCentiv pulls those tweets into a stream feed where a team can @ direct reply to the Tweet with a discount nudge to make a purchase: @NFLfan, were with you  football season cant start soon enough. To make sure youre ready for your first tailgate, how about 15% off something in our fan store? Click here for the offer.<br></p><p>As any sales person will tell you, 25 million motivated, potential consumers spells o-p-p-o-r-t-u-n-i-t-y. Analysts calculate the value for the 2014 sporting events market was around $80 billion with impressive growth projected for the foreseeable future. (<a href="https://www.atkearney.com/documents/10192/5258876/Winning+in+the+Business+of+Sports.pdf/ed85b644-7633-469d-8f7a-99e4a50aadc8">AT Kearney.com</a>) So even a small fraction of that industry offers huge returns.<br></p><p>SocialCentiv gives sports marketers a unique way to capture those dollars through the underutilized Twitter marketing channel, Perrine says. We offer managed services, where SocialCentiv handles the outreach and follow-up with fans on Twitter, along with a do-it-yourself version for companies that prefer to take care of that themselves. Either way, our customers get a powerful but affordable tool that helps them reach consumers with marketing messages at the moment those folks are most receptive to receiving them.<br></p><p><b>Winning big</b></p><p>From ticket sales and distribution companies, to major networks and college sports programs, SocialCentivs technology has helped sports-related organizations score major victories, according to Jason Dove, the companys senior VP of sales and marketing.</p><p>Last spring one of the major networks signed on to help promote March Madness, and during the Final 4, they saw a 47 percent click through rate (CTR) on the apparel campaign and a 24 percent CTR on a sweepstakes promotion, Dove says. And we are about to launch promising fall football campaigns for two Atlantic Coast Conference universities that have campaigns focused on ticket sales, merchandise and sweepstakes promotions.<br></p><p>Other successes: A large ticket distributor was able to boost sales to selected East Coast college basketball games. And a major broadcast network partnership with SocialCentiv yielded conversion rates of 47 percent on a Twitter campaign to sell collegiate athletic apparel in early 2015.<br></p><p>SocialCentivs conversion rates for the network were also outstanding on Twitter marketing efforts related to baseball (35 percent,) hockey (47 percent) and a college basketball-based sweepstakes (24 percent.)<br></p><p>On average, when presented with advertising messages in SocialCentiv-run campaigns, Twitter users click on the marketing links 34 percent of the time, Dove notes. Thats phenomenal. But in our sports marketing business, we have achieved click-through rates of as much as 42  52 percent.<br></p><p>And as football season gets underway, SocialCentiv clients are poised for even bigger gains, he adds.<br></p><p>For sports marketers, social media is the granddaddy of them all, he concludes. The uninitiated can find learning the nuances of social marketing to be frustrating and time-consuming. But by leaving the heavy lifting to us, businesses can have the confidence that we will execute the game plan and deliver a win.<br></p><p><b>About SocialCentiv</b><br></p><p>In August 2014, HipLogiq integrated its portfolio of Twitter marketing applications under a single product line, SocialCentiv.

An ACTIVEON video contest is giving away $2,000 a week for outstanding videos submitted to ACTIVEON.com.

The ACTIVEON CX includes an iOS and Android smartphone app to easily control the cameras functions, monitor live video, and share content directly to social media, said Frank Donato, Executive Vice President of ACTIVEON.</p><p>Action cameras today are owned by fewer than one in ten households, according to the Consumer Electronics Associations most recent CE Ownership Study. The CEA study also says that 85% of those making a purchase in the action camcorder category are first-time buyers.</p><p>The action camera market to nearly double in size from some 10 million units sold this year to nearly 20 million units by 2018.  Thats why weve designed the ACTIVEON CX to include premium features but at a great value, Donato explains.</p><p>Review samples are available for qualified media.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><u>Premium Features and Great Value</u></i></p><p>Unlike similar products in its price range, the ACTIVEON CX includes a two-inch LCD display and an 1100mAh, two-hour removable battery that can be swapped with accessory replacement batteries to insure that you dont miss a minute.  The new ACTIVEON CX action camera captures video at 1080p/30 frames per second with a 5 megapixel CMOS video sensor.  The ACTIVEON CX camera also includes a six-element F/2.4 high precision bright glass lens that provides a 160-degree field of view. </p><p>The fully featured ACTIVEON CX carries a suggested retail price of $119.99.&nbsp;&nbsp;ACTIVEON cameras and accessories are widely available now at Target, Sears, BestBuy.com, Walmart.com, Aarons, B&amp;H Photo and BrandsMart, as well as directly from ACTIVEON.com.<br></p><p>In addition to the ACTIVEON CX camera, buyers get a waterproof case, adhesive mount, battery and charging cable.  The waterproof case is airtight up to 196 feet under water -- deeper than the competitions similar case -- and the adhesive mount can stick to a helmet, surfboard, or just about any surface.  This battery lasts up to two hours, and if you need more time, you can quickly swap it out for a fresh one.  And the ACTIVEON CX comes with a universal quarter-inch screw mount, so it fits on almost all standard tripods and mounts, Donato explains.</p><p>The ACTIVEON CX ships with the removable waterproof housing and includes an Aqua mode to minimize distortion when shooting under water.  The CX shoots time-lapse photos and video, is equipped with auto image rotation, and can be personalized with one of six optional faceplates in white, lime, orange, red, blue, and purple.</p><p>The ACTIVEON CX includes an easy menu-driven interface allows a user to toggle between video and photo modes.

Richemont announces that it has entered into a binding, conditional agreement to merge the operations of its subsidiary, The Net-A-Porter Group, with YOOX S.p.A. (YOOX or YOOX Group) in an all-share transaction. YOOX Group is the global Internet retailing partner for leading fashion brands, which has established itself amongst the market leaders with the multi-brand online stores yoox.com, thecorner.com and shoescribe.com, as well as with numerous mono-brand online stores. YOOX S.p.A. is incorporated in Italy and is listed on Borsa Italiana, the Italian stock exchange. Information on YOOX Group can be found at <a href="http://www.yooxgroup.com">www.yooxgroup.com</a><br><br>The agreement is conditional upon the approval of YOOX shareholders at a meeting which it is expected to be held in June 2015. Upon completion of the transaction, the combined entity will be renamed YOOX Net-A-Porter Group, will continue to be incorporated in Italy and listed on Borsa Italiana. Ms Natalie Massenet, Founder and Executive Chairman of The Net-A-Porter Group, will serve as Executive Chairman and Mr Federico Marchetti, Founder and CEO of YOOX Group, will be CEO of the combined entity.<br><br>Richemont will receive, in aggregate, on a fully diluted basis 50 % of the share capital of the combined entitys listed parent company. In order to preserve the independence of YOOX Net-A-Porter Group, Richemonts voting rights will be limited to 25%. Richemont has committed to a lock-up period of three years in respect of shares equivalent to 25% of the total share capital of the combined entity. Upon completion, Richemont will appoint two representatives to the combined companys board of directors, which will have a minimum of twelve members. Following completion, YOOX Net-A-Porter Group is expected to launch a capital increase of up to &nbsp;200 million to fund future growth opportunities and allow for the entry of strategic investors. Richemont is expected to participate in this capital increase.<br><br>Richemont has been a pioneer in luxury e-commerce, first as a minority shareholder of Net-A-Porter in its infancy and then as a controlling shareholder since 2010. We are proud of Net-A-Porters achievements under the leadership of Natalie Massenet, ably assisted by a wonderful team of professionals. Established business models are being increasingly disrupted by the technological giants. It is with this in mind that we believe it is important to increase leadership and size to protect the uniqueness of the luxury industry. The merger of the two leaders will further enhance an independent, neutral platform for a sophisticated clientele looking for luxury brands.<br><br>The transaction is expected to complete in September 2015 after shareholder and regulatory approval. Thereafter, Richemont will equity account its investment in the enlarged YOOX Net-A-Porter Group. This transaction will generate a one-off, non-cash, accounting gain in Richemonts financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2016 of approximately &nbsp;317 million (at both the pre- and post- tax levels), based on currently available information. Excluding the one-off, non-cash accounting gain, the transaction is otherwise expected to be broadly earnings neutral in terms of Richemonts net income for the financial year ending 31 March 2016, based on currently available information.<br><br><br><br>About Richemont<br><br>Richemont owns a portfolio of leading international brands or Maisons which are managed independently of one another, recognising their individuality and uniqueness.

Richemont and EPFL announce the creation of an academic chair in Multi-scale Manufacturing Technologies. The future professor will work at EPFLs Neuchâtel Microcity Campus, home to its Institute of Microengineering.<br><br>The continuous optimisation of manufacturing processes for mechanical components is one of the key success factors of the Swiss watchmaking industry. While traditional machining and stamping processes will continue to play an important role, emerging technologies such as laser machining, 3D printing and plasma etching are pushing the current limits to new heights of quality and performance. In order to capture this outstanding potential, Richemont and EPFL are creating an academic chair in Multi-scale Manufacturing Technologies. Richemont, a key Swiss player in the watchmaking and jewellery industry, will sponsor the activities of the future professor in EPFLs Institute of Microengineering. The recruitment process has already started.<br><br>Microengineering, and the watchmaking sector in particular, are essential components of the industrial landscape in Western Switzerland.

The integration of these new technologies in production will reinforce Switzerlands leadership position in high-precision industries and high-end watchmaking. In particular, it will improve the performance and quality of watches, allowing for the use of new materials and enabling the fabrication of the most complex components.<br><br>We are faced with a demanding and sophisticated client base, increasing competition and continuous technological progress. Innovation is a necessity for a major global company like Richemont, says Co-CEO of Richemont, Richard Lepeu. These new technologies open a wide range of technical possibilities to respond to future industrial requirements.<br><br>By investing in this high-potential sector, Richemont and EPFL confirm their determination to play a leading role in innovation.

New brand design, tone of voice and sonic logo<br><br>Zurich, 1 September 2015  UBS launched its first global brand campaign since 2009 today, reflecting the firm's strategic transformation and future direction. Featuring a distinctive brand film as well as advertising with images by Annie Leibovitz, the campaign also refreshes the strong UBS brand with a contemporary look and feel. The external launch follows a three-month internal campaign that inspired unprecedented rates of employee engagement.<br><br>"The brand campaign is an expression of the successful strategic transformation UBS has undergone over the past four years," said Sergio P. Ermotti, Group Chief Executive Officer. "Reflecting the strategic transformation through our branding gives us additional momentum."<br><br>Together, we can find an answer<br><br> The brand campaign features a brand film with a series of questions asked in the voice of clients. The film consists only of text on a white background accompanied by Family of the Year's hit song "Hero." The campaign line following the film and all other advertising is "For some of life's questions you are not alone. Together we can find an answer." The photography for the campaign features portraits by Annie Leibovitz of entrepreneurs who embody specific questions.<br><br>Reflecting the focus UBS places on sharing expertise, all advertising links back to a microsite that addresses a number of the questions from the campaign with thought-provoking content. Over the next two years, for example, this will include video interviews with more than 40 Nobel-Prize-winning economists.<br><br>New brand design, tone of voice and sonic logo<br><br> With the brand campaign, UBS is also introducing a new mobile and digital-friendly brand design, a simpler and clearer tone of voice and a new sonic logo. These elements as well as the campaign approach are based on extensive research undertaken by the firm over the past two years. The research focused on client personalities and motivations, factors differentiating UBS and testing of campaign execution.<br><br>"We were going for a uniquely recognizable and emotional campaign and a brighter more modern UBS brand. Really doing our homework with exhaustive research and testing helped get us there," said Hubertus Kuelps, Group Head of Communications &amp; Branding.<br><br>Digital execution<br><br> Reflecting the media consumption of its client base, over 70% of the media investment for the campaign is focused on digital channels including social media. This allows UBS to target its specific client audience while also measuring the success of the individual creative assets to optimize and adapt them as needed.<br><br>"Our clients stand at the center of this campaign and the vast majority of them are extremely digitally savvy," said Johan Jervøe, Chief Marketing Officer. "They appreciate a bank that has an effective and efficient 21st-century approach to everything it does  including marketing."<br><br>Annie Leibovitz partnership<br><br> In conjunction with the global brand campaign, UBS has announced a wider cultural partnership with Annie Leibovitz. The bank has commissioned a body of new work from the photographer, focusing on portraits of women who effect positive change. These and existing works will be shown at an international exhibition tour entitled "Women." The exhibition will launch in London in January 2016 and travel to 10 global cities over 12 months. Alongside the commissioned photography, UBS will present behind-the-scenes footage online offering glimpses of how the celebrated photographer works and gains insight into her subjects.<br><br>To access the advertising material, the microsite and further information go to: <a href="http://www.ubs.com/together">www.ubs.com/together</a>.<br><br>UBS worked with Publicis, Poke, Prophet, SNK, Format Punkt E, The Writer, Massive Music and Mediavest on the brand strategy, design refresh, creative execution and media investment.<br><br>About UBS<br><br> UBS is committed to providing private, institutional and corporate clients worldwide, as well as retail clients in Switzerland, with superior financial advice and solutions, while generating attractive and sustainable returns for shareholders.

This is what being disrupted looks like.<br><br>Shares in&nbsp;Cabcharge&nbsp;sank to their lowest level&nbsp;in 12 years on Friday.<br><br>This means that since November 2012, the stock has sank by over 50 per cent,&nbsp;compared to a rise of about 13 per cent for the broader market, as measured by&nbsp;S&amp;P/ASX All Ordinaries Index.<br><br>Why do we start in November 2012? That was when&nbsp;Uber, the app enabled ride hailing service, first launched services on Australian soil. (Uber&nbsp;X, its more controversial ridesharing&nbsp;product, hit these shores in May 2014).<br><br>To be clear, Cabcharge's business is under pressure on multiple fronts, not just from&nbsp;Uber. It also being attacked by&nbsp;local taxi booking apps like goCatch and Ingogo. As Fairfax Media's Patrick Durkin reported this morning&nbsp;goCatch, has signed a deal with ASX-listed Mint Payments to try and snare more of the taxi payments market away from Cabcharge.<br><br>?Cabcharge is also being hurt by&nbsp;new regulations in NSW, Victoria and Western Australia&nbsp;that cut&nbsp;surchages paid on taxi rides in half.<br><br>For the record, Cabcharge has&nbsp;has said it is yet to notice any impact on its business from Uber and any of its other app based rivals. Yet markets are forward looking, and they could be pricing in further pain for the business. Analysts from&nbsp;Goldman Sachs, which are&nbsp;neutral&nbsp;on shares of Cabcharge,&nbsp;said last month they are&nbsp;worried that the rise of ride sharing services like Uber&nbsp;"could&nbsp;substantially&nbsp;erode taxi patronage",&nbsp;reducing Cabcharge's&nbsp;transaction volumes in coming years.<br><br>Uber's ridesharing service, Uber&nbsp;X, is technically illegal although&nbsp;its status is being reviewed by multiple state governments.<br><br>Disruption is a term that is thrown around a lot, often inappropriately. But a disruptive innovation, according to the person who coined the phrase,&nbsp;Clayton Christensen, refers to "a product or service takes root initially in simple applications at the bottom of a market and then relentlessly moves up market, eventually displacing established competitors".<br><br>It&nbsp;would seem that in the context of&nbsp;Australia's personal transport market,&nbsp;Uber&nbsp;fits this&nbsp;bill.<br><br>Who knows what it may or may not achieve in coming years.&nbsp;The company is exploring&nbsp;self-driving cars&nbsp;and some people think it could eventually own a fleet of autonomous vehicles available for rides so cheap that owning a car becomes redundant. But whether that actually transpires is anyone's guess.&nbsp;<br><br>

<p>  </p><p>With the joint purpose to help people feel their best by conquering every day battles, Massage Envy and the Arthritis Foundation are leveraging their national partnership to host the fifth annual Healing Hands for Arthritis® (HHFA). The one-day national fundraising and awareness event will take place on Wednesday, Sept. 16 at over 1,000 Massage Envy locations across the country. </p><p>  </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>  </p><p>For every 1-hour massage or facial session, Massage Envy will donate $10 to the Arthritis Foundation to support new scientific discoveries, create a faster path to a cure and provide valuable resources to help people with arthritis live their best life. In addition, ten percent of Massage Envy retail sales from Murad, Performance Health (Biofreeze and Bon Vital) and Wyndmere will be donated that day. </p><p>  </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>  </p><p>"Through our collaborative partnership with the Arthritis Foundation, we've been able to bring awareness to the therapeutic benefits of regular massage for those with arthritis," said Debbie Gonzalez, chief brand officer at Massage Envy.

It is the nation's leading cause of disability, costing more than $156 billion annually in lost wages and medical expenses and the loss of 172 million work days. </p><p>  </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>  </p><p>"The potential benefits of massages for those with arthritis, aligns with our goal to be the Champion of Yes - providing personalized help and support for people dealing with the daily challenges of arthritis," said Ann Palmer, president and chief executive officer of the Arthritis Foundation.

James Pattinson, chief ordnance officer at Reluctantly Brave and former P&amp;G brand marketer argues that his biggest challenge will be balancing 'blue chip' culture with the risk-embracing culture of smaller competitors.<br><br>Like Lafley, Taylor has spent his entire career at P&amp;G. This is because P&amp;G has a recruit from within policy - each graduate joins P&amp;G with the idea that they could one day be CEO - Its one of the reasons P&amp;G has such a strong culture.<br><br>This appointment is important because P&amp;G is seen as one of corporate Americas classic blue chip companies but it has struggled since the great recession started. Taylor has a big challenge on his hands to steer the company through what is being termed the&nbsp;"most comprehensive transformation in [its] history".<br><br>For the last few years, P&amp;G has been engaged on a productivity and growth strategy which many have seen as simply job losses and cost cutting. There are parallels here to be drawn with the Greek economy.<br><br>But the question for Taylor is what path should he take to return P&amp;G to growth? And can cost cutting and productivity gains really be sustained? Or does he need to enact a culture change?<br><br>P&amp;G, often cited as one of the best companies for leadership development in the world, is an amazing company with highly evolved processes and procedures, honed over the last 170+ years of its history.<br><br>It also has the gold standard in marketing and a strong heritage of innovation - from developing the modern brand management system, to pioneering employee stock ownership. It is a business with solid fundamentals to build from.<br><br>However, despite its many strengths, it also has many challenges.<br><br>The rigour, processes and scale of a business like P&amp;G can also be big obstacles to effective decision making. This is especially apparent when the external environment has changed so much.<br><br>Speed, flexibility and agility are more important than ever before. Markets and demand patterns are in flux, leaving P&amp;G being out-performed by rivals.<br><br>P&amp;G is a business, like other blue chip's, that values continuity and consistent strategy improvement. So it is therefore extremely unlikely there will be revolution under Taylor's watch any time soon.<br><br>Not least because Taylor has worked for Mr. Lafley for 20 years and will have been carefully groomed for succession.&nbsp; He is a product of the very system that he needs to evolve.<br><br>I know from personal experience at P&amp;G that there is a restless desire to improve, change and reach for better solutions. But at the same time P&amp;G may benefit from a culture that is more innovative and more willing to take risks. In P&amp;Gs case, incremental changes could add up to a significant change in overall performance.<br><br>Taylor could, for example, consider introducing what we refer to as a Profense approach.<br><br>This is combining a defensive strategy (protecting whats important) with a proactive, forward moving strategy - adding small elements of innovation into everyday P&amp;G processes in order to enact cultural change. But brand teams would need to feel empowered to take risks with internal process to achieve this, which can be a challenge at a business the scale of P&amp;G.<br><br>Taylor might also benefit from bringing different voices and perspectives into the organisation. Though a business can never "buy in" the change an organisation needs, bringing different voices into decision making and introducing perspectives from outside 'blue chip culture'&nbsp;can pay dividends.<br><br>It's not easy to move to a more innovative, risk embracing culture. However, P&amp;G has a track record of making the changes necessary to win now, and in the future. And with 170 years of being one of the biggest players in FMCG, there is no reason why it should not make another century.
<p>LA mom Jennifer Johnson couldnt be happier that her dream of launching a <a href="http://www.babystrongworkout.com/" target="_blank">unique mom and baby workout product</a>&nbsp;is finally coming true  all thanks to an incredibly successful Kickstarter campaign. Launched on July 27, 2015, the Kickstarter campaign had a goal of raising $9,000 to help fund the manufacturing of a brand new deck of workout cards called Baby Strong Workout. Baby Strong Workout is an inexpensive and effective way for moms to workout using baby as the weight. With only 30 days of campaigning, Baby Strong Workout surpassed its goal and raised $9,181 by the August 26th deadline. Now Jennifer is excited to bring her cards to life and spread the word to moms across the country to change their lives for the better.</p><p><br></p><p>Baby Strong Workout creator Jennifer Johnson shares, I am beyond ecstatic that the Kickstarter campaign was so successful and so many moms will be able to get Baby Strong  I know they will love it, have a great time doing it and be blown away by how effective the exercises are! This is a doable and fun way to exercise with a baby that every mom can do, no matter her size, shape or fitness level. I know this is just the beginning for Baby Strong Workout and Im already planning out the next versions that will be released.</p><p><br></p><p><img width="200" alt="baby-strong-workout-02jpg" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/112592/baby-strong-workout-02-jpg" height="300"></p><p><br></p><p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.babystrongworkout.com/" target="_blank">Baby Strong Workout deck</a>&nbsp;was inspired by Jennifers son Cole, a high needs baby who would never let Jennifer put him down. As a personal trainer and perinatal exercise specialist, this threw Jennifer for a loop as she could not leave Cole to head to the gym and working out while Cole napped was out of the question. Jennifer soon found that incorporating Cole into her workouts was fun for both of them and she got in the best shape of her life  all by carrying Cole wherever she went and for all of her workouts. Thats when she had an aha moment and realized she needed to bring this workout to new moms everywhere so they could receive the same health benefits.</p><p><br></p><p>Each Baby Strong deck includes individual exercise cards and a series of pre-made workouts. Moms can do one-off exercises, put together their own workouts or try the pre-made ones to get a great workout no matter what.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMA0pzHKrT0" target="_blank"><img width="400" alt="videopng" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/112592/video-png" height="278"></a></p><p><br></p><ul><br><li>This innovative deck of exercise cards&nbsp;incorporates your baby in every single exercise. Baby is held by mom the entire time, either as your weight during resistance exercises or in your arms while you strengthen and stretch.</li><br><li>No more choosing between baby care and mommy care.&nbsp;Take care of baby while you take care of yourself. </li><br><li>Build functional strength so you can do all of the things you need and want to do as a mom.</li><br></ul><p><br></p><p>The Baby Strong Workout cards will be available for regular purchase starting November 2015. Those who helped back the project and pre-ordered a card deck will be the first to receive the workout cards.

<p><i>Allows Retail Coin Dealers to Offer Interactive Customer Experience</i></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ADDISON, TX (September 17, 2015)  Dillon Gage Metals, an international precious metals wholesaler, has launched an innovative point of sale component on FizTrade.com for retail coin dealers. Now, customers can have an immersive in-store experience and shop for inventory online while browsing real-time precious metals pricing.<br></p><p>The point of sale platform was introduced at last months American Numismatic Associations Worlds Fair of Money convention in Rosemont, Ill. </p><p>Heres how it works: Using a traditional or tablet-based computer, retail coin dealers tap into Dillon Gage Metals proprietary FizTrade network, allowing them access to an immense selection of coins priced according to the current market. This technology allows retail coin dealers the opportunity to interact with customers on the floor where they can display, discuss and conduct sales of product beyond what is available in store. Key advantages of the point of sale platform include a much wider selection of coin inventory than what the retailer typically maintains on-site, and customers get the benefit of locking in real-time prices for their purchases. &nbsp; Dillon Gage clients who utilize the portal are able to brand it with their company logo and produce receipts for their customers that bear the dealers name and company information.</p><p>The point of sale platform is designed to engage and enhance the retail experience and customer interaction while creating efficiencies for the shop owner, said Terry Hanlon, president of Dillon Gage Metals. Dealers are particularly excited about this technology, which allows the customer to lock in the current metals price for purchases from a much wider inventory than dealers traditionally have on hand. This technology gets the retail sales force out from behind the counter and into a more hands-on sales consultation for a measurable return on investment. Additionally, the FizTrade Point of Sale component reduces the dealers market risk because they are selling and buying the metal based on the same spot market price. In a volatile market, this is extremely beneficial</p><p>The real-time pricing feature is expected to add an additional layer of trustworthiness to the sales process. Even in the most volatile markets customers can view up-to-the-second pricing information while engaged in the sales process. Retail coin dealers have the ability to customize their own premiums for each product in the online catalog. We find that dealers like having access to a full product catalog from which they can manage premiums and sell their own product as well, stated John Humphrey, executive vice president of Dillon Gages Digital Metals.</p><p>With the addition of the point of sale platform on the FizTrade network, Dillon Gage Metals demonstrates their commitment to remaining the industry leading wholesaler when it comes to dealer-friendly technological advancements in the precious metals marketplace.

The Swiss bank UBS announced today that it will commission the photographer Annie Leibovitz to do portraits of notable women. The new works will be a continuation of her 1999 series Women, shown first at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and will join the 35,000 other pieces that form the firms art collection.<br><br>In January, in a show also titled Women, the new photographs will make their first appearance in London before traveling to Tokyo, San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore, Mexico City, Istanbul, Frankfurt, New York, and Zurich over the following 12 months. The exhibition will be free of charge to the public.Leibovitzs 1999 Women photographs include portraits of Louis Bourgeois, Hillary Clinton, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Gloria Steinem. Im very moved by the sense of dignity these women have, Leibovitz said in 1999, noting that the subjects of these works show how we look and what we do. Though the subjects of the new commissions have yet to be announced, UBSs PR firm told ARTnews that the women in these photographs will be notable. The new Women portraits will document the ways that womens roles are changing in a society where feminism has recently come to the forefront.We are delighted to announce this special partnership with Annie Leibovitz, Johan Jervøe, the global chief marketing officer for UBS, said. Throughout her career Annie has captured the pulse and tenor of contemporary life, creating unique, personal and insightful portraits that have become her trademark. This exhibition will celebrate women affecting positive change. We want to enable as many people as possible to see and respond to this thought-provoking series and to be inspired to fulfill their own creative practice.
<p>Fifteen years ago Annie Leibovitz embarked on a book of portraits titled Women made in collaboration with her late partner, writer Susan Sontag. Although Sontag passed away in 2004, Leibovitz continued expanding the series. UBS announced today that it has partnered with the photographer for a global tour of the series, which features new portraits  reflective of the changes in the roles of women today.</p><p>The exhibition tour will be free to the public and will launch in London this January and will continue to 10 cities around the globe, including Tokyo, San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore, Mexico City, Istanbul, Frankfurt, New York and Zurich.</p><p>The new photographs will become part of the UBS Art Collection, one of the most important corporate collections of contemporary art comprised of more than 35,000 works by artists like Cindy Sherman, Tina Barney and Sam Taylor Wood. &nbsp;The partnership also marks UBSs continued support of the arts Aligned with the focus UBS placeson education,learning programs will accompany the exhibition presented in partnership with cultural organizations around the world, reads a release. These initiatives will explore ways of seeing through photography, working with young people in local communities.</p><div></div><p>We are delighted to announce this special partnership with Annie Leibovitz, said&nbsp;Johan Jervøe, Global Group chief marketing officer of UBS.&nbsp;Throughout her career Annie, has captured the pulse and tenor of contemporary life, creating unique, personal and insightful portraits that have become her trademark.

<p>Beijing, September 14, 2015 ­ Baidu, Chinas largest search engine, recently announced an initiative on its Baidu Library (Wenku) platform to provide translations of educational materials in the native languages of several Chinese ethnic minority groups. Education materials for primary and middle schools, including homework exercises, teachers class preparation notes, and teachers presentation decks, will be made freely available in Uygur, Kazakh, Tibetan, Mongolian, and Korean, with additional languages to come. The initiative aims at the expansion of educational equality among different minority nationality groups in China.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The initiative, called the Desert Poplar Plan (?????)named for a species of willow, <i>Populus euphratica</i>, that grows in arid regions of Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia? will provide translations from Chinese to primary and middle school students in areas like Xinjiang and Tibet where bilingual teachers are few and far between. The program will reach an estimated 5 million students and 270,000 primary and secondary school teachers. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Teaching materials available online in digital formats in standard Chinese are abundant, with over 54 million education-related documents on Baidu Librarycompared to almost none for the languages the Desert Poplar plan will cover. This has resulted in a significant gap in education equality between Han Chinese and ethnic minorities. Ethnic minority students have not traditionally had access to the massive amount of educational materials and references available to their counterparts in other parts of China.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Volunteer translatorsmainly local bilingual teachers and education researchersnow number over 4,000. Since May, when the project kicked off, teams have already translated more than 10,000 documents. Translation work has focused with materials on math, Chinese, and science, subjects on which ethnic minority students identify a more urgent need.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Baidu Library has enabled search for these documents within the Baidu Library database in native ethnic minority languages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Baidu also launched a special campaign on Baidu Library, where Baidu will donate one yuan to fund the Desert Poplar Plans fund each time the campaign page is shared on social media. The funds will go to compensate translators and develop multilingual search capability within Baidu Library. The campaign page can be found at <a href="http://wenku.baidu.com/huyanglin">http://wenku.baidu.com/huyanglin</a>. This campaign was launched on September 10International Teachers Dayand already more than 10.69 million yuan has been raised for the cause. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>                                             </p><p>Since November 2009, Baidu Library has been an invaluable resource where people can upload and share documents with other Baidu users. Over 130 million documents are available on Baidu Library, and the site gets approximately 50 million unique daily visitors generating 500 million daily page views.</p>
<p><b>The Marketing Software Companys Stats Show Superior ROI for Engaging and Selling on Twitter</b></p><p>Lead generation is a multi-billion dollar industry. <a href="http://www.socialcentiv.com/">SocialCentiv</a>, marketing software that helps businesses find new customers on Twitter, announces superior performance on return on investment (ROI) across six vertical industries when compared to Google AdWords. Thats because SocialCentivs dynamic platform uses multiple keywords to engage consumers at the exact moment theyre expressing a need for something, which in turn which delivers a lower cost-per-click (CPC) and higher ROI.<br></p><p>Companies are taking notice. SocialCentivs managed account services have grown 80 percent over the past 10 months. New features like multiple campaigns, suggested replies and conversion tracking make cost per acquisition easy to determine, and big brands and small businesses alike are adding SocialCentiv as a tool in their lead generation arsenals and noticing an average 34 percent CPC rate.</p><p>In an era when the cost of online marketing is getting out of hand, SocialCentiv is providing a strong alternative for reaching consumers at the moment they are ready to buy, says Bernard Perrine, the companys co-founder and CEO. Our software allows companies to avoid the competitive bidding wars other social platforms put advertisers through and achieve what marketing is supposed to provide: a return on investment.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Outperforming the digital market</b></p><p>In general, digital marketing makes ROI much easier to calculate. It has proven itself to be less expensive and easier to track as potential customers click through ad messages. Companies can justify the ad spend because they arent charged unless a consumer clicked on the ad  the CPC.</p><p>From a digital marketing standpoint, Twitter is a strong channel because 1) its public in nature and regular users expect replies and reactions to their Tweets; 2) two of the most commonly used phrases are I want and I need, meaning people are looking for solutions in real time; and 3) Twitter marketing is underutilized and offers unique opportunities for businesses to engage directly and provide consumers with a solution to the want or need they Tweeted about.<br></p><p>SocialCentivs patented software is successful because it provides the chance for businesses to offer a real-time, personalized reply to Tweets filtered out by the platform with keywords and location. SocialCentiv pulls relevant Tweets onto a business Tweet Stream so someone can immediately @ reply directly with an offer or discount to win that consumers business. Another key benefit of SocialCentivs service is that it permits businesses to use the keywords they prefer  without competing in auctions for keywords with artificial prices.

<p><i>Landmark Broadcast Delivers Pristine 4K Ultra HDTV Signals</i></p><p><b>SEOUL, Sept. 21, 2015 </b> Leading Korean broadcaster SBS partnered with LG Electronics for the first live over-the-air broadcast of 4K Ultra HD signals using technologies behind the emerging ATSC 3.0 next-generation television broadcast standard.</p><p>Youngsoo Park, SBS Chief Technology Officer, said this marks the first time ATSC 3.0 broadcasting technologies have been successfully tested in Korea. This is significant achievement in realizing the feasibility of new broadcasting technology and an important first step in preparation for next years test transmissions here.</p><p>SBS and LG successfully demonstrated transmission and reception of 4K UHD and HD mobile signals simultaneously in a single 6-MHz channel. LG also demonstrated capability to receive HD mobile signals in a fast-moving vehicle using the robust technology expected to be part of the ATSC 3.0 physical layer.</p><p>Dr. Skott Ahn, President and CTO, LG Electronics, said, LG is leading the way in development and commercialization of ATSC 3.0. Test broadcasts like this show how we are partnering with broadcasters around the world to drive adoption next-generation broadcasting technology.</p><p>This months landmark Korean broadcast comes on the heels of field tests in the United States conducted since last fall by LG Electronics, its Zenith R&amp;D Lab, and GatesAir.</p><p>The real-world field tests in Seoul, Cleveland and Madison, Wis., represent important milestones in the collaborative effort by LG, GatesAir and Zenith to develop core technologies behind the new ATSC 3.0 Standard. Their innovations are expected to be used in the majority of the baseline Physical Layer transmission system, which is likely to become an ATSC Candidate Standard next month.</p><p>Expected to redefine TV broadcasting for decades to come, the next-generation ATSC 3.0 broadcast standard will require higher capacity to deliver 4K Ultra-High-Definition services, robust reception on mobile devices and improved spectrum efficiency. The increased payload capacity of the physical layer combined with HEVC encoding will allow broadcasters many more options when planning their broadcast service offerings.</p><p>Development of ATSC 3.0 technologies represents the latest collaboration among LG, Zenith and GatesAir, co-inventors of the transmission system behind the ATSC A/153 Mobile Digital TV Standard, adopted by the industry in 2009.

<p>This may be the most unique and yet totally genius project created in the name of safety. For the past two years Byte Logic Systems Inc have been pouring hard work and dedication into the worlds first GPS tracking system in an incredibly under-appreciated every day accessory shoelaces!</p><p>Consider the extremely practical applications that this new gadget can offer before overlooking it. The safety of small children, the disabled and the elderly could be dramatically increased by utilising this wonderful application of existing technology, blended seamlessly into everyday use. On a daily basis thousands of elderly dementia sufferers, people with Autism and small children are unable to be found due to wandering away from carers and their homes. Currently, the procedure for locating these people is contacting Police authorities and setting out a search party in the hopes that they have not been gone long enough to achieve great distances. On the occasion that these lost individuals are approached by a considerate citizen it is rare that they will be in possession of a bracelet or dog-tag necklace with their details on it. To solve this all too common predicament, the G-Lace was created using the latest applied GPS tracking technology.</p><p>Byte Logic Systems Inc have recently launched their crowdfunding campaign with the leadership of their Senior Software Developer and founder, Carlos Martinez. Their dream is to see a second prototype of the G-Lace to improve its capabilities and make its practical applications even more versatile.

During a recent interview Carlos has described the G-Lace as An innovative way to keep individuals from being lost if they wander and doing it discreetly to avoid any discomfort. Byte Logic Systems Inc believe that the implementation of the G-Lace into society will cut the missing persons count in the USA by half, which is an extremely positive outlook. Society will gradually become safer for the children, the ill and the elderly and will offer carers and the like peace of mind in the tedious stresses and worries of day to day living.&nbsp;</p><p>By showing support to the G-Lace via the Indiegogo campaign, backers can receive their own G-Lace to utilise with their loved ones.</p><p>Visit <a href="http://igg.me/at/worlds-first-gps-shoelace"><b>http://igg.me/at/worlds-first-gps-shoelace</b></a> for more information.</p><div><br></div>

<p><i>More than Dozen Key Building Blocks Comprise&nbsp;</i><i>Next-Generation Broadcast TV Transmission System</i></p><p><b>WASHINGTON, Sept. 29, 2015 </b> The Advanced Television Systems Committee announced today that the Physical Layer transmission system for ATSC 3.0 next-generation television broadcasting has been elevated to Candidate Standard status. The ATSC TG3 Technology Group approved the ATSC 3.0 Physical Layer Candidate Standard.</p><p>&nbsp;Over the course of months leading up to this vote, hundreds of volunteers have evaluated proposed technologies all with the mindset of selecting the best and most flexible transmission system as the foundation of ATSC 3.0. This represents a major milestone, and we expect to see manufacturers developing prototypes that can test the more than a dozen interconnected core building-block elements of the Physical Layer, said ATSC President Mark Richer.</p><p><i><b><br></b></i></p><p><i><b>Flexible, Robust and Efficient</b></i></p><p>The ATSC 3.0 Physical Layer is intended to offer far more flexibility, robustness and spectrum efficiency than the ATSC 1.0 standard, which was adopted two decades ago. The ATSC 3.0 physical layer allows television broadcasters to choose from a wide variety of transmission parameters so that each station can tailor its signal to best serve its local market by providing the combination of services and coverage area best suited for the market and its terrain.</p><p></p><blockquote>The system will allow high-capacity, low-robustness modes and also lower-capacity, high- robustness modes in the same transmission. That flexibility means that were likely to see both 4K Ultra HD broadcasts running side-by-side with robust mobile broadcasts to handheld devices, Richer explained.</blockquote><p></p><p>Technologies can be selected for various use cases like Single Frequency Networks, Multiple Input/Multiple Output channel operation, channel bonding and more, well beyond a single transmitting tower. There are a large range of selections for data protection including a wide range of guard intervals, forward error correction code lengths and code rates.<i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i><b>ATSC 3.0: Suite of Standards</b></i></p><p>ATSC is grateful for the support and active involvement of some of the best minds in broadcasting from around the world to develop the standard for the Physical Layer. But this is not the end of the process. The Phy Layer Candidate Standard sets the stage for field testing in the months ahead leading to the Proposed Standard phase in 2016, Richer said. </p><p>Work continues on the other parts of the suite of ATSC 3.0 standards. They include Video and Audio Compression, Closed Captioning, Advanced Emergency Alerting, Security, Companion Devices, Personalization, Applications &amp; Interactivity, Watermarking and Fingerprinting, and Internet Protocol Delivery. All told, some 20 standards are expected to be part of ATSC 3.0.</p><p># # #</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>About the ATSC: The Advanced Television Systems Committee is an international, non-profit organization developing voluntary standards for digital television.

Irrelationship is a jointly created defense system that two or more people maintain in order to avoid awareness of the anxiety thats a natural part of becoming close to others  especially anxiety about letting people see and know us for who we really are. Irrelationship happens outside of awareness, working well to protect us from anxiety, intimacy, and emotional investment while blocking mutually satisfying relationships from developing.<br><br>Those in irrelationship generally tend to fall into the role of either Performer or Audience. The Performer desperately tries to take care of the Audience, and the Audience hangs back and lets the Performer try to rescue and fix him or her. By doing so, the Audience is also taking care of the Performer by giving her or him the opportunity to avoid anxiety by getting caught up in those same futile activities. While it fends off anxiety, it only leads to repetitive cycles of fighting and withdrawal.<br><br>Irrelationship is often seen in people drawn to one another in romance; but can just as easily affect friendships, work-life, family, and even society and culture.<br><br>While the basic idea of irrelationship is straightforward, getting a deeper understanding of how it works, what sustains it, the many ways it can manifest, and how to start finding ways out of irrelationship into real relationship is complex. These facets in particular are helpful starting points:

<p>The transgender community has rarely seen the spotlight throughout the history of cinema, but in a moving twist, Strictly Taboo: A film noir transgender love story, is ready to break the status quo. The social issues surrounding the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) community are diminishing slowly as their exposure becomes more frequent. <u>Strictly Taboo has embraced the unspoken challenges of an intimate relationship between a heterosexual man and a transgender woman in the modern world.</u> </p><p>Visit the <a href="http://bit.ly/StrictlyTaboo " target="_blank">'Strictly Taboo'&nbsp;Indiegogo campaign</a></p><p>Throwing Mud Productions Inc is a film production company proudly showcasing Strictly Taboo as its first feature film.

The CEO of Throwing Mud Productions is also the man responsible for the writing and directing of the film. Bob McAndrew has an esteemed and lengthy career in writing, directing and teaching, including bragging rights of previous students who have become Academy Award winners. His directing resume is highlighted by previous films with various awards and accolades from numerous corners of the globe. Bob feels strongly that Strictly Taboo expresses the heart and soul of a transgender person, and believes that it will foster tolerance and understanding for individuals in the LGBT community all over the world.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/robin8-production/robin8-production/9760a9a6-5935-4ba6-8298-998e6ecd69ca/11223480_563056693833478_5170208050332316179_n.jpg" title="Image httpwwwucarecdncom9760a9a6-5935-4ba6-8298-998e6ecd69ca"><br></p><p>Bob began writing Strictly Taboo before the LGBT community was widely acknowledged, and naturally he experienced difficulty and disinterest when presenting the idea before media companies. Recently however, there has been an increased awareness of the social issues surrounding the LGBT community, in part thanks to programs such as Orange Is The New Black and Becoming Us. Additionally the victory in US Supreme Court which has now affirmed the rights to same sex marriage has been a major contributor to the increase in acceptance and understanding within society. Bob has embraced this opportunity to finally see his vision brought to life.</p><p>It is evident that Strictly Taboo will be stand out film to challenge and educate wider society about the heart wrenching trials faced by LGBT people.

<p><b>Launched by Food-Loving Social Tech Veterans, Bestaurant Lets Friends Make and Privately Share Lists of Favorite Restaurants</b><br></p><p>SAN FRANCISCO, February 21, 2015</p><p>SAN FRANCISCO, February 21, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Bestaurant is the new mobile app that offers food-lovers and travelers a streamlined and superior way to answer questions like: Wheres the best steak in New York City? The creators of Bestaurant today announced the official launch of the app on both the iPhone and Android platforms. Unlike the thousands of existing apps and websites that offer user-generated restaurant reviews by strangers, Bestaurant is designed to access favorites from friends, making it the first smartphone app to leverage social and mobile technologies to unlock favorite global eating experiences. Bestaurant users create and share their personal Gold Lists of favorite restaurants in a city, nominating one restaurant per cuisine to declare their pick of the best place for  . Bestaurant covers over 50 major cuisines and over 500 major cities.</p><p>Our simple insight was that peoples best restaurant experiences mostly come from friends personal recommendations  not review sites, guidebooks, or other media. Yet, amazingly, before Bestaurant there was no smartphone app that made the recommendation process among friends easy and efficient. Bestaurant combines social and mobile technology to make the world a more happy place by filtering for only top picks of great meals, said Dominic Penaloza, Founder of Bestaurant. </p><p>The dozens of major, user-driven review sites and apps, editorial-driven review sites and apps, and restaurant-focused blogs and forums all missed the mobile/social/local boat. Most peoples best dining experiences still tend to happen by way of recommendations by people they know and with whom they share common tastes in dining and lifestyle. Restaurant reviews from strangers simply do not fit well enough and by the time you find out the hard way, its already too late. At the same time, people have a huge passion for sharing food photos on mobile social networks, but this is not an efficient way to discover the right restaurants when you need them. Our innovation enables you to easily tap into your friends fondest memories, whenever you need it, so that you can spend more time enjoying the best meals and avoiding the mediocre.</p><p>Bestaurant is also a great tool for in-the-know foodies to archive their lists and share them quickly. There are countless times Ive been solicited by friends for recommendations in different cities, says Dominic. Each time, Ive had to type my recommendations by memory into an e-mail and if I was feeling particularly charitable, Id look up the addresses for each. This process has taken me up to 45 minutes of researching and writing. With Bestaurant, I finally have a platform to build and store my Gold Lists with addresses, maps, telephone numbers and opening hours automatically built in, making it a fantastic reference source for friends as well as myself.</p><p>Bestaurant is organized around each users Gold Lists, first by city and then by cuisine. Users recommend one restaurant for each cuisine, ensuring that Bestaurant remains uniquely focused on top favorites. Users can include photos and add comments and tips. They are encouraged to share their Gold Lists with existing friends and can also follow other users to access their Gold Lists. A location-based map view is useful for finding restaurants nearby, especially when traveling in a new city. Users can also easily fulfill specific cravings by filtering by cuisine, or by city and friends.</p><p>{screenshot showing a Gold List for Los Angeles}</p><p>{screenshot showing one restaurant page, with gorgeous photo of dish}</p><p>Dedicated to building an indispensable tool for food lovers, features of Bestaurant include:</p><ul>  <li><b>Bestaurant</b>, meaning best restaurant, is the users top      pick of each cuisine or situation; when you Bestaurant a place it means youre      saying it is the #1 place for that kind of cuisine or situation</li>  <li><b>Gold      Lists</b> created by each Bestaurant user featuring the      users Bestaurants, a useful repository of food experiences that makes it      easy to share recommendations when your friend asks you: Wheres the best      sushi in Shanghai? </li>  <li><b>Comprehensive      Restaurant Profiles</b> with beautiful photos and accurate      information, your friends reviews, and community reviews including top      restaurant experts and professionals</li>  <li><b>Directly      Call Restaurants </b>simply by tapping      the phone number on the Restaurant Profile</li>  <li><b>Explorable      Food Map</b> that helps users discover great new food      experiences in their own neighborhood or when traveling in new cities</li>  <li><b>Private      Sharing </b>of Bestaurants and      Gold Lists between friends, everything in Bestaurant is privately shared      between friends and there is no public sharing of any user content </li> </ul><p>Bestaurant is optimized for the user who wants to find a great restaurant, not just any restaurant. For example, its helpful when I want to arrange a business dinner in a new city or when I travel, since a huge part of the travel experience for me is actually the food, said William Bao Bean, Partner at SOSventures and a member of Bestaurants advisory board. I derive no value from knowing that there are one hundred restaurants all around me; I derive huge value from easily seeing which restaurants around me are highly rated by my friends.</p><p>Each Bestaurant is worth more than a review. In this era of oversharing, scarcity is meaning. Bestaurant is pioneering efficient curation for the mobile era. Each Bestaurant is like my personal seal of approval, said [ expert ].</p><p><b>About Bestaurant<br> </b>Bestaurant is a social tool that helps users find the best restaurants by enabling friends to share lists of favorite restaurants. &nbsp;Bestaurant users recommend only one top choice per category per city so their friends know each place is great.&nbsp; Guided by the core principle that friends recommendations are the most efficient way to find great restaurants, Bestaurant aims to be a game changer in the restaurant and travel discovery market.&nbsp; The Bestaurant team is comprised of veteran entrepreneurs, technologists, designers, and food lovers building social technology to innovate in the multi-billion dollar restaurant and travel industry. &nbsp;For more information, visit <a href="http://www.bestaurant.co">http://www.bestaurant.co</a></p><p>                                                  </p><p><img width="3" alt="Description httprtprnewswirecomrtgifNewsItemIdSF67255Transmission_Id201308210800PR_NEWS_USPR_____SF67255DateId20130821" src="file://localhost/Users/dominic/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/msoclip/0/clip_image002.png" height="3"></p>
<p>For the majority of people it is common place to have accounts with multiple social media platforms at any one time. The concept of social media has grown into a necessity, rather than an exciting or novel thought for internet users. Whopple is the creative work of an entrepreneur who saw earning potential with the amount of time spent on social media daily<b>. Whopple is the revolutionary concept of a social media form that literally pays its members.</b> Whopple has launched its Indiegogo campaign to transform this innovative idea into a reality.</p><p>Visit <a href="http://igg.me/at/whopple/x/11871144">http://igg.me/at/whopple/x/11871144</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Social media hype began long before the internet and even before computers became an everyday household item. It is now an integral part of modern society, with general social networks and special interest niche sites available. There are sites to share photos, videos and thoughts, as well as internet dating websites and even sites to connect family history or catch up with old class mates. The existence of social media sites is not only for personal socialising, but business connections such as Linked In. Big and small business utilise social media to collect information and utilize this information to target specific audiences with advertising schemes. Social media is now one of the biggest mediums for advertisements since television. Imagine a social media site that not only connected hundreds and thousands of like-minded members, but also rewarded them with payment for sharing one anothers pages.</p><p>Whopple creator and visionary, Jeff Baugh Jr. has a detailed plan for the structure of Whopple and how it will benefit its members. The average person spends up to 2.5 hours a day on social media, and Jeff would like to see that time both used productively and rewarded, instead of wasted. Whopple will consist of members who can share and connect like any other social media site, but can also sponsor other sites and receive payment through a multi-tiered structure.

September 2015 reported retail new vehicle unit sales for AutoNation's operating segments were as follows:<br><br> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			    for Domestic, up 27% versus September 2014, <br>13,593 for Import, up 17% versus September 2014, and <br>6,147 for Premium Luxury, up 20% versus September 2014.<br> 											 			   		  	 		  			     &nbsp;<br><br><br> 					  					 			   		  	 		  			     On a same-store basis, reported retail new vehicle unit sales in September 2015 increased 18% as compared to September 2014.

These reports are prepared based on the sales transaction reporting standards established by the applicable automotive manufacturers, which differ from revenue recognition and other requirements under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). For example, the classification of certain transactions under the standards established by certain such manufacturers differs under GAAP. Transactions reported as retail sales include vehicles placed into certain manufacturer-approved demonstrator vehicle and service loaner programs, which vehicles may be sold by our stores to retail customers as new or used vehicles under GAAP in subsequent periods. Manufacturers sometimes provide marketing incentives to place vehicles into such programs during particular periods. In addition, the sales reports are based on the time periods set by the automotive manufacturers for reporting monthly sales, which generally differ from the calendar month and may be modified by particular manufacturers from time to time. As a result, our operating results calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, including our new vehicle unit sales, may differ materially from any results expressed or implied by the information provided in our monthly sales reports and summarized in this news release and future news releases. In addition, reported retail sales are subject to seasonal trends. Consequently, reported retail sales for a particular month are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full quarter or year. Please refer to our public filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 and our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, for additional information regarding our business.

<h5>Oct. 16 Is National Mammography Day<br></h5><p><b>ADDISON, TEXAS (Oct. 7, 2015) </b>Solis Mammography reminds women that its time to schedule their annual mammogram. And this year, Oct. 16, National Mammography Day, is the perfect day to do it!</p><p>Typically observed on the third Friday every October, President Bill Clinton proclaimed the first National Mammography Day in 1993.</p><p>Mammograms are all about taking charge of a healthy life, says Connie Oliver, Solis vice president of marketing and client relations. Octobers intense focus on breast cancer actually creates anxiety for many women that sadly keeps them away from mammography centers for fear theyll get a bad result. We want to remind women that the majority of our patients wont get breast cancer in their lifetime; but if something uncharacteristic does appear, the earlier we find it, the easier their treatment options will be.</p><p>Solis also wants women to know that all mammography providers are not the same. In other words, a mammogram is not just a mammogram.</p><p>Solis believes knowledge is power, and educated women are empowered women. Here are three things that most women dont even know to ask about:<br></p><p><b>Choice:</b> Women get to choose where they have their mammograms. Its smart to put as much thought into the choice of your mammography provider as you do when choosing your doctor.<br></p><p><b>Technology:</b> Ask if a center has <a href="http://newsroom.solismammo.com/2015/10/01/3d-mammography-fact-sheet/">three-dimensional (3D) technology</a>  not all centers do. Also known as tomosynthesis, 3D is the newest medical technology in the quest for earlier detection. Whats the difference? Imagine a book with clear covers and pages. With 2D digital mammography, the radiologist must peer through the cover and all the pages at once, looking for a single word that does not have the same characteristics as all the other words. With 3D mammography images of the breast are taken in discreet 1mm slices, so the radiologist has the ability to look for that irregular word one page at a time. Research shows these increased views lead to a 37 percent reduction in unnecessary callbacks, saving time, money, and most importantly, anxiety.<br></p><p><b>Who reads the mammogram: </b>Ask if a center has <a href="http://newsroom.solismammo.com/2015/10/01/breast-imaging-specialist-fact-sheet/">breast imaging specialists</a> reading their screenings. These specialists are radiologists who spend more than 90 percent of their time reading breast images and read more than 5,000 mammography images per year. All of Solis breast-dedicated radiologists read between 7,000 and 10,000 screening and diagnostic mammograms each year.</p><p>There is a lot more to the annual screening than simply showing up at a center where your doctor tells you to go and hoping for the best, says Oliver. Thats why Solis wants women to reclaim the month of October and <a href="http://newsroom.solismammo.com/2015/10/01/what-is-rethink-p-i-n-k/">Rethink P.I.N.K.</a> Instead of focusing on breast cancer awareness, the company urges women to think about October as breast <b><i>health</i></b> awareness, celebrating women with a positive message of empowerment.<br></p><p>The American Cancer Society recommends that women age 40 and older should have a mammogram every year and continue to do so for as long as they are in good health. Other organizations cite every other year as the optimal time to get checked. Solis Mammography encourages women to talk to their doctor, explain their unique health history, and make the choice thats right for them. When they are ready, however, Solis is there to offer an exceptional experience  eliminating stress and anxiety in every way possible.<br></p><p>My annual mammogram revealed something different from the previous year  something that couldn't be felt by monthly breast checks, says Solis patient Patty Hill. Two small surgeries later, I was a survivor with no need for radiation or chemo. Due to early detection by Solis, my only treatment is anti-estrogen tablets. I am one of the lucky ones. Will I continue with annual mammograms? You had better believe it!<br></p><p><b>About Solis Mammography</b><br></p><p>Solis Mammography is a specialized healthcare provider focused exclusively on providing women an exceptional mammography experience.

NEW YORK, Oct. 6, 2015 -- BERRICLE, a reputable lifestyle jewelry brand, introduced its promise ring collection. The collection includes an exquisite array of rings in both contemporary and classic designs. In anticipation of the holiday season, promise rings are expected to be an ideal gift option for couples.<br><br> 					 			   		  	 		  			     A promise ring is a symbolic gift of commitment, often considered as a precursor to an engagement to pledge a couple's love for each other. Given that it is not intended as a marriage commitment, a promise ring is usually inexpensive and presented in a less culturally significant way.<br><br> 					 			   		  	 		  			     BERRICLE's Promise Ring Collection embraces figural, gemstone and non-traditional styles that will beautifully complement the uniqueness of each relationship. With the popularity of the promise ring trend, BERRICLE has woven in a wide variety of styles for a truly versatile collection. From claddagh silhouettes to art deco flairs, the collection celebrates exquisite rings of enduring design elements. <br><br> 					 			   		  	 		  			     With the numerous options available, it may seem overwhelming. How to pick out the perfect ring? Base it on her personality. If she is polished and mellow, an emerald or canary color will be an ideal fit for her sophistication. If she is flamboyant and glamorous, a princess-cut or radiant-cut will most likely swoon her. If she is edgy and unconventional, then a marquee-cut or bezel-set will bring out the unique qualities in her.<br><br> 					 			   		  	 		  			     Claddagh rings are anticipated to be very trendy in the upcoming festive season, as the design depicts two clasped hands holding a heart. The sign of bonding love will serve as a touching reminder of constant love. <br><br> 					 			   		  	 		  			     "Promise rings are such a great addition to our repertoire. Now we are able to provide beautiful and meaningful choices for couples at different stages in their relationships," said Kevin Chen, President of BERRICLE.<br><br> 					 			   		  	 		  			     The best timing of gifting a promise ring depends on the specific situation of each couple. Typically, a promise ring makes a romantic anniversary or birthday gift, thanks to the pure promises attached to the symbolic sparkler. Holiday season also tends to be a desirable occasion to declare your devotion entwined into a beautifully crafted ring. <br><br> 					 			   		  	 		  			     The nature of the promise ring extends beyond partnerships.

<p><b>NCAA Athletic Recruiting: LemonAid Is the App for That </b></p><p><i>LemonAid  an app that connects college-bound swimmers and university recruiters  launches on Android and iOS</i></p><p><b><i>Ashburn, Virginia  October 5, 2015</i>  </b>For high school swimmers and university coaches, the recruiting process can feel like treading water. Its an endless whirlwind of emails, phone calls, campus visits and paperwork. LemonAid  a newly launched iOS and Android app, co-founded by former American Record holder <a href="https://vimeo.com/141073391" title="Link: https://vimeo.com/141073391">Eric Knight</a>  offers a fast, convenient solution. </p><p>Swimmers and coaches create profiles in LemonAid based on their academic, social and athletic preferences. LemonAid then matches compatible athletes and coaches. To connect, users swipe right or left, and ultimately, matches can message directly in the app. &nbsp;Think Tinder meets LinkedIn for NCAA athletic recruiting. </p><p>For high school athletes, LemonAid eliminates the stress of selecting a college swim program. Athletes build a profile that contains relevant information like GPA, competition times, and their events. Completed profiles, in turn, help showcase their talent and get them in front of recruiters. For coaches, LemonAid offers a friendly, quick introduction to talented swimmers and makes future interactions all the more powerful. </p><p>LemonAid (<a href="http://lemonaidapp.co" target="_blank">lemonaid</a>app.co) is FREE for athletes and coaches, with paid features (upload performance video and right swipe preview) available. &nbsp;To download the app, visit</p><p>&nbsp;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lemonaid/id990585674?ls=1&amp;mt=8" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/robin8-production/robin8-production/24aeb4c7-89c4-42ad-be1d-d2eaf97399fe/AppstoreBadge.png" title="Image https3amazonawscomrobin8-productionrobin8-production24aeb4c7-89c4-42ad-be1d-d2eaf97399feAppstoreBadgepng"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elitecrest.lemonaid&amp;hl=en" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/robin8-production/robin8-production/c89a4319-3ab6-4ac5-af66-9eb4d9b45590/playstorebadge.png" title="Image https3amazonawscomrobin8-productionrobin8-productionc89a4319-3ab6-4ac5-af66-9eb4d9b45590playstorebadgepng"></a><br></p><p><b>LemonAid: Co-Created By Former NCAA Student-Athlete Eric Knight</b></p><p>In high school, LemonAid co-founder <a href="https://vimeo.com/141073391">Eric Knight</a> had dreams of swimming in college. The problem: Eric was a lemon. He wasnt a great swimmer, but he was determined. </p><div><iframe frameborder="0" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/141073391?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;badge=0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></div>Ultimately, Eric walked on to the swim team at George Mason University.&nbsp; It was a transformative experience. By the time he graduated, Eric had earned 10 team and three conference records. But if he had given up when no schools showed interest, it would have never happened. <p></p><p>LemonAid was born out of Erics experiences with NCAA athletic recruiting. Finding a team was daunting, especially for a lemon like Eric. He co-created the app to help all student-athletes  and especially lemons like him  connect with coaches, find a team and take advantage of the transformative experience of NCAA athletics. &nbsp;</p><p><b>For more information about </b><a href="http://lemonaidapp.co" target="_blank"><b>LemonAid</b></a><b>, or to schedule an interview, contact:</b></p><p><b>Nate Boyle, CEO &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eric Knight, Co-Founder</b></p><p>Phone: 703.727.0241 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Phone: 703.963.5031</p><p>Email: nate@lemonaid.cc &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Email:&nbsp; eric@lemonaid.cc</p><p>Twitter: @nate_boyle &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Twitter: @eric_the_knight</p><p>                                  </p><p>LinkedIn: nateboyle &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LinkedIn: ericknight2</p>
<p>What Data Tells You about KOL Marketing?</p><p>5 indicators on why KOL marketing is the next big thing 5</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What is KOL Marketing?</p><p>As the world has shifted to social media, consumers look at fellow consumers to inform&nbsp;their&nbsp;purchasing decisions. Instead of using traditional media outlets, as they did in the past, they now look at each other and at their favorite personalities, who are consolidating massive followings on Twitter, Facebook,&nbsp;Weibo,&nbsp;Wechat&nbsp;or other social networks.</p><p>They are subject-matter experts, personal&nbsp;brands,&nbsp;bloggers who are customers themselves and have already earned trust of your potential customers. Why dont you let them lead your marketing campaigns?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here we found 5 indicators on why KOL marketing is the next big thing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1. Its Powerful</p><p>There are few things that drive a sale more effectively than a warm word-of-mouth recommendation. A study by McKinsey found that marketing-induced consumer-to-consumer word of mouth generates more than twice the sales of paid advertising. And of those that were acquired through word-of-mouth had a 37 percent higher retention rate.</p><p>KOL marketing presents a glaring opportunity for brands to leverage the power of word-of-mouth at scale through personalities that consumers already follow and admire.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. Its Social</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A new report from&nbsp;Salesforce&nbsp;found that 70 percent of brands are increasing their social media spend this coming year.</p><p>Traditionally, consumers made purchasing decisions based on the advertisements that they saw or heard. Today, its easier to connect with other consumers via social media and make better purchasing decisions by learning about their experiences with a product or service.</p><p>People expect brands to talk&nbsp;with&nbsp;them rather than&nbsp;at&nbsp;them. Brands can strategically partner with the right personalities to spark organic conversations and seduce their followers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. Its An Arbitrage</p><p>An arbitrage exists when something is selling for cheaper than it is actually worth. The difference between the goods market price and real value is your profit. In short, it is an opportunity to make big profits with a small effort.</p><p>Arbitrages are common in advertising. For instance, when Facebook first launched its ad network, early adopters reaped record returns on investments (ROIs) because nobody else was competing for the ad-space. However, as Facebook became more popular, more marketers started bidding for ad-space, driving the prices up by more than 335 percent in 2014 and evaporating everybodys ROI.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4. It Helps Your SEO</p><p>On top of building your brand and improving your sales numbers, KOL marketing also helps your search engine ranking. According to The Social Media Revolution, user generated social posts account for 25 percent of search results for the worlds top 20 brands. The more people mention your brand on social media, the more popular and relevant you will be on Google.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5. Consumers Are Tired of Paid Ads</p><p>According to research firm&nbsp;Yankelovich,&nbsp;the average American is exposed to 5,000 advertisements a day. Whether or not that number is scientifically proven, it gets the point across: we are exposed to A LOT of ads.</p><p>In fact, we see so many that were unconsciously tuning them out, a phenomenon called banner blindness.&nbsp;Infolinks&nbsp;found that only 14 percent of their respondents could remember the last ad they saw and identify what was being promoted. With all of the advertising interrupting them, its no surprise that people love products like&nbsp;AdBlock, Netflix, and&nbsp;Spotify&nbsp;Premium that take ads out of traditionally ad-saturated media experiences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www.robin8.com" title="Link: http://www.robin8.com">www.robin8.com</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>
<p>Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care opened locations in Coppell, Frisco, Keller, McKinney and North Richland Hills this week, making it the nations largest stand-alone provider to offer both urgent care and emergency room services under one roof. Headquartered in Plano, Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care has an additional location in Frisco and one Allen.</p><p>Our hybrid model is unique to Texas  there are no stand-alone ER-urgent care hybrids in other states. There are only three here in Texas, and we are by far the largest in terms of locations, employees and patients, said Keith Miller, president of Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care.</p><p>Under the hybrid model, Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care patients only pay emergency room prices when its truly an emergency, but they still have access to board-certified physicians and state-of-the-art equipment that is not usually available in stand-alone urgent care centers.</p><p>Stand-alone urgent care centers arent required to have a doctor on site and typically dont have the same kind of treatment and diagnostic equipment available. Thats why so many of them get a Doc in the Box reputation, said Dr. Jay Woody, Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Cares founder and chief medical officer. However, if you go to an ER, youre charged ER prices even though about 70 percent of ER visits arent truly an emergency. Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care is different. We give patients a better option.</p><p>In celebration of the new locations, Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care is offering $10 flu shots in all the communities it serves. Flu shots are usually covered under health insurance, and we can check that for you when you come in. If youre covered, then the shot is free; but if you dont have insurance or your insurance doesnt cover you 100 percent, then this may be a good option for you, Miller explained.</p><p>                    </p><p>Urgent care and ER hours will be the same in all locations. Urgent care is available from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. daily, and ER services are accessible 24-7, 365 days a year. Online check-in is available at legacyer.com, and walk-ins are welcomed.</p>

<div><div>As we continue sending prayers for Lamar Odom and his loved ones, lets take a moment to understand the estate planning issue presented.</div><div><br></div><div>In most states, including Illinois where I am a lawyer, in an emergency, a persons spouse can make healthcare decisions for their incapacitated spouse. &nbsp;If a married person wants to have someone other than their spouse be responsible for making their emergency healthcare decisions, then that married person needs to complete a healthcare power of attorney to designate someone else. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This 'spousal power' to make healthcare decisions typically terminates upon divorce. &nbsp; However, absent a healthcare power of attorney being completed, a soon-to-be-ex-spouse may remain the healthcare agent until the day the divorce is final.</div><div><br></div><div>Yes, I know, thats a terrifying thought. </div><div><br></div><div>From media reports, Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom had signed the divorce papers, and likely, considered themselves divorced. &nbsp;However, until the divorce papers have been entered into the court, a divorce may not be final. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Since the divorce is not final, Khloe was thrusted into the uneviable position of having to make life or death decisions for the husband she's divorcing. &nbsp;My hat's off to her, Khloe is doing a phenomenal job handling one of the toughest roles on the planet. &nbsp;However, she may not have had to endure this role if Lamar had completed a healthcare power of attorney. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So, while we continue to send the Odom and Kardashian families prayers of health and strength, take a moment to take control of your own healthcare. &nbsp; Complete a healthcare power of attorney to appoint someone to make healthcare decisions for you, if you are unable to make them yourself. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Click here for a link to download a <a href="https://legacycompanies.leadpages.co/health-care-poa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">healthcare power of attorney,</a>&nbsp;FREE! &nbsp; Or, better yet, contact an estate planning attorney to create your entire estate plan. &nbsp;</div><div>--------------------</div><div>Kimberly Jean Brown is a licensed attorney in Illinois. &nbsp;Attorney Brown is on hiatus from her law firm to help launch the startup&nbsp;an online living trust platform that brings cost-conscious consumers together with skilled attorneys to create customized living trusts. &nbsp; LegacyComplete.com launches in November 2015. &nbsp;Kimberly can be reached at (773) 249-4400 x 700, Kimberly@LegacyComplete.com</div><div>----------------------</div><div><i>Legal disclaimer: &nbsp;Although I am an attorney, I am not your attorney. &nbsp;I am not giving you legal advice. &nbsp;Therefore, no attorney-client relationship has been created. &nbsp; &nbsp;Attorney Advertisement.</i></div></div>

<p>Tuesday, October 20, 2015, Memphis, TN  Today and tomorrow, law enforcement and political leaders will converge on Memphis, home of the largest known rape kit backlog, to share best practices and other useful information. &nbsp;Yet, the public and media are banned from the events.<br></p><p>Representatives from <a href="http://www.enforcerapelaws.org" target="_blank">People for the Enforcement of Rape Laws</a> (PERL), a Memphis-based anti-rape advocacy organization, were unable to attend the meeting, which had been promoted by local officials for months.</p><p>The public has little faith in law enforcement handling of rape cases, said Meaghan Ybos, Executive Director of PERL. &nbsp;The secrecy of this summit undermines the credibility of officials who claim that Memphis police have changed their ways.</p><p>In fact, Memphis stands behind MPDs handling of past cases, Ybos noted. &nbsp;The public cannot be expected to take the departments word that it has fixed institutional problems.</p><p> </p><p>Ybos isnt the only Memphian to lambast the secrecy of the rape kit summit.</p><p>Jeni Diprizio of WATN remarked: "I love it when Memphis' media relations person keeps the media out of an event and then police tell a photographer he can't even shoot video in the lobby of a public building and gets in front of the camera to block him. Nope, this time it wasn't me but I really wish I had been there! As for their "top secret" summit, don't worry I was able to call and get the agenda from a different, more transparent administration!"</p><p>Keli Rabon, a former Memphis reporter who<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK0mow1CVQ"> first investigated MPDs use of rape kits in 2010</a>, commented: I'm disappointed there isn't a session on how to lie to the media about your rape kit problem.</p><p>It is unclear what sources have funded this summit.<br></p>
<p>NEWS<br></p><p>For Immediate Release</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FEMA LAB LAUNCHES PERMANENT TESTING OF ADVANCED WARNING AND RESPONSE NETWORK</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Life-Saving Technology Will Leverage Next-Generation ATSC 3.0 Broadcast TV Standard</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>WASHINGTON, Oct. 20, 2015  The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agencys Integrated Public Alert and Warning System <a href="https://www.fema.gov/testing-ipaws-lab-jitc">(IPAWS) Lab</a> is now playing host to a technology demonstration of <a>AWARN</a>  the Advanced Warning and Response Network. </p><p>Developed and supported by leading technology companies and broadcasters, AWARN will leverage next-generation broadcast technology to transmit next-generation emergency alerts to the public. AWARN capitalizes on existing emergency alerting standards and builds upon the Mobile Emergency Alert System (M-EAS) developed during a pilot project and standardized by the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FEMAs testing, in the IPAWS Lab located at the Joint Interoperability Test Command in Indian Head, Md., will demonstrate the feasibility and operational deployment of AWARN within the IPAWS suite of technologies and allow public safety officials to gain confidence using IPAWS in a secure environment, according to FEMA. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>AWARNs equipment will be put through its paces at the IPAWS Lab, where closed-environment testing will be employed to assess its capabilities. Testing will begin with M-EAS using current-generation digital broadcast technology as a solid foundation for advanced emergency alerting using next-gen broadcasting technology. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>AWARN senior advisor John Lawson, president of <a>Convergence Services, Inc</a>., called broadcast Advanced Emergency Alerting a major addition to FEMAs network of networks for public safety communications. It will provide vital information to the public whether or not the cellular network is functioning or the electric grid is intact, he explained. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The current U.S. broadcast standard, the <a>ATSC</a> &nbsp;A/53 Digital Television Standard adopted in the 1990s, is being upgraded to a new more flexible and powerful version called ATSC 3.0. This new broadcast system, currently being standardized, promises to provide a more robust transmission, a higher data throughput and improved indoor reception. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Integrated into the new ATSC 3.0 standard will be a capability for Advanced Emergency Alerts such as AWARN. Mobile digital television reception is a core component of the new standard, meaning that the same broadcast signal going to home TV sets can easily be simultaneously transmitted to ATSC 3.0-equipped smartphones and tablets. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just as with M-EAS, AWARN is designed to integrate seamlessly with IPAWS. Alerts generated by state, regional, or local authorities currently trigger text and tone alerts under the legacy Emergency Alert System to be received by viewers and listeners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>AWARN uses the new capabilities inherent in ATSC 3.0 to deliver rich media alerts. Video, photographs, text, evacuation routes, maps, plume models, radar images, html pages, shelter information, Amber Alerts and more can be transmitted as part of the AWARN alert. </p><p>This advanced use of rich media allows the public to search for more information on each alert issued, all via the broadcast transmission stream or, to put it another way, without using their data plan or having to access LTE or 4G at all. The use of Internet Protocol technology allows the new application to be flexible and extensible. Data delivery, non-real-time delivery, and electronic service guides are all included. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lawson said that testing at the IPAWS Lab will address more than technical issues. It also is an opportunity for emergency managers to move beyond text messages and sirens to distribute rich media assets, including multilingual and accessible alerts, such as text-to-speech. He said initial FEMA testing with first-generation technology lays the groundwork for further testing of the very robust advanced alerting system as the ATSC 3.0 standard process proceeds over the next year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>AWARN is supported by leading broadcasters and technology companies including; Gates Air, LG Electronics (and its U.S. R&amp;D subsidiary Zenith), Digital Alert Systems, Monroe Electronics, Triveni Digital, NAB Labs, Capital Broadcasting, PBS, Convergence Services, and others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>###</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>AWARN Media Contacts:</p><p>Dave Arland, Arland Communications&nbsp; - Dave@ArlandCom.com&nbsp; - 317-701-0084</p><p>John Taylor, LG Electronics USA - <a href="mailto:John.Taylor@lge.com">John.Taylor@lge.com</a> -&nbsp; 202-719-3490</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>News Release from FEMA</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>October 20, 2015</p><p>HQ-15-073</p><p>Contact: FEMA News Desk</p><p>Phone: 202-646-3272</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FEMA to Assess Future Over-the-Air Broadcast Alerting Technology</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>WASHINGTON The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) National Continuity Programs Integrated Public Alert and Warning System Division has begun to assess the feasibility of a public alert and warning capability that is being developed in the private sector. &nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>New technologies could deliver detailed emergency information to the public with pictures and videos of evacuation routes, storm tracks, and shelter information  increasing community preparedness before, during, and after a disaster. The media alerts will be able to include multilingual and multi-format information to warn non-English speaking populations and people with access and functional needs. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FEMA is committed to working with the private sector to examine and improve future alerts and warnings, said Roger Stone, Acting Assistant Administrator for National Continuity Programs. New systems could someday include pictures and video as part of the advanced alert and warning information provided to the general public.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One such technology being considered is the Advanced Warning and Response Network (AWARN).  AWARN works by using advanced capabilities in the next generation of digital television broadcast system called ATSC 3.0 being standardized by the Advanced Television Systems Committee.  The emerging television broadcast standard provides for the transmission of large media rich, data messages over-the-air to mobile, portable, and fixed television and video devices without interrupting ongoing television shows. &nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FEMAs IPAWS is a national system for local alerting. IPAWS enables authorities at all levels of government to alert and warn people in areas endangered by disasters. IPAWS is used by federal, state, and local authorities to send emergency alerts to cellular phones as Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs), to radio and television as Emergency Alert System (EAS) broadcasts, to NOAA Weather Radios, and to an All-Hazards Alert and Information Feed for Internet applications, services, and websites.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For more information on IPAWS, go to <a href="http://fema.pr-optout.com/Tracking.aspx?Data=HHL%3d%3e493.CP%3f%401A39377.LP%3f%40083%3a&amp;RE=IN&amp;RI=711798&amp;Preview=False&amp;DistributionActionID=6426&amp;Action=Follow+Link">www.fema.gov/ipaws</a>. </p><p>###</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FEMA's mission is to support our citizens and first responders to ensure that as a nation we work together to build, sustain and improve our capability to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from and mitigate all hazards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Follow FEMA online at <a href="http://www.fema.gov/blog" title="Link: http://www.fema.gov/blog">www.fema.gov/blog</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fema" title="Link: http://www.twitter.com/fema">www.twitter.com/fema</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/fema">www.facebook.com/fema</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/fema">www.youtube.com/fema</a>.

<h2>Online Shopping Just Became A Lot More Addictive<br></h2><p>Todays online shoppers are not satisfied with just discount catalog shopping, they want more! While most shopping apps and online stores like Amazon, eBay or Etsy try to sell you products at a discount or sell it at an auction, this new shopping marketplace changes online shopping by taking a different approach altogether.&nbsp;</p> <p>In traditional auctions, prices start at a low reserve and buyers bid their way higher. At <a href="http://bitly.com/ibuysell90sec" target="_blank">iBuySell</a> - a social mobile marketplace, <b>prices keep falling from a preset price till the first person snaps up the product adding an element of suspense and fun</b>. The limited time frame adds to the rush and excitement. <b>There are no biddings, so the first person to hit the buy-it-now button gets to purchase the product </b>at the price it was set at. The product is then considered sold and no longer available for purchase.</p> <blockquote>Most online platforms are nothing but discount catalogs, products move slowly, it's hard to get discovered, upfront promotion costs are too high and the fees are astronomical. There are not many options available for small retail owners and individual entrepreneurs to make their life easy says Macungie, Pennsylvania based co-founder Kaus Mukherjee. So we thought why not combine shopping for incredible deals with a little fun and suspense, to make it an engaging experience? The buyer is always intrigued if they will be the first to get the item or will someone else will take it? Here there are no hassles of bidding and the entire live action lasts for less than 90 secs.</blockquote> <p>Kaus migrated from India to United States in the late 90s. He stumbled upon this idea of iBuySell as he and his wife Suchi went about exploring several options to setup an online retail business. While he has been a technologist all his life and currently employed as a manager at Citigroup, she is a realtor. The common interest of both: Shopping and Technology!</p> <p>At <a href="http://bitly.com/ibuysell90sec" target="_blank">iBuySell</a> you are not limited to sell just designer brands such as Coach, Louisvuitton, Chanel handbag, shoes and accessories but you can also sell jewelry, homewares, tech gadgets, sports items and much more. <b>Buyers can expect to purchase the items anywhere from 50-80% of their original price</b> depending on demand and nature of the item.</p><p>iBuySell is shaping up to be a great place to buy and sell items, attracting brands, retailers, boutique shop owners and individual entrepreneurs who are looking to drive sales and improve profit margins. </p> <blockquote>At <a href="http://bitly.com/ibuysell90sec" target="_blank">iBuySell</a>&nbsp;we believe everybody has something to sell or buy. Our mission is to provide a platform which benefits a seller as much as a buyer. A seller is the backbone of our marketplace and supporting them would also translate to benefits being passed on to the buyers says founder and CEO Kaus. Our sellers have a choice of paying a low monthly fee starting at $49 or pay per transaction (10-15%) which is much less compared to competitors fees of more than 20%. There are no fees for listing an item and we encourage sellers to include their e-commerce website details in their profile to drive traffic to their existing business</blockquote> <p>The team has made a lot of progress in completing the design of the app, applying for patent and trademarks and hiring specialists for developing the app, they need help to raise funding to complete development and the app is schedule to be released in beta by November of 2015. To realize this objective the team has launched a <a href="http://bitly.com/ibuysell90sec" target="_blank">crowdfunding campaign at Fundable</a>. </p><blockquote>We are excited about launching our campaign as means for not only raising funds to help create the app but also to spread the word and increase adoption says Suchi.</blockquote> <p><b>Success of iBuySell will result in not only a unique, exciting and rewarding experience for shoppers it will also allow thousands of brands, retailers and entrepreneurs a platform to grow their existing business faster, drive sales by engaging their customers and keep more in profit without paying too much in upfront costs.</b></p> <p>Teaser video of how iBuySell works - <a href="https://youtu.be/e8M0gt0en5w">https://youtu.be/e8M0gt0en5w</a></p> <p>To learn more about iBuySell or support their crowdfunding campaign click <a href="http://bitly.com/ibuysell90sec" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
Working with text is often a messy business for programmers. While code has to be unambiguous, words tend to be anything but. Over the years, a number of companies like Alchemy and Thomson Reuters have launched services based on natural language processing (NLP) and machine-learning algorithms to help developers more easily extract meaning from documents. Now, Aylien is joining the fray with its own text-analysis API, the first in a series of developers services the company is working on.<br><br>The service was founded by Dublin, Ireland-based Parsa Ghaffari, with the backing of Chinaccelerator. Ghaffari told me that he first applied to the accelerator program with the idea for a product that used NLP to automatically pull up relevant data while you were writing about it. It turned out, though, that the underlying technology for this didnt exist. He then set out to build the technology, and the result of this  after almost three years of work  is Aylien.<br><br>The API allows developers to quickly extract basic data like headlines and the body of text from a document, but it also offers a summarization service, entity and concept extraction, and language and sentiment detection. Ive used the API for a couple of personal projects and with the exception of a few issues, it worked as advertised. It doesnt like texts in languages other than English, though, and was almost 100 percent confident that this German post about Googles latest Street View project expansion was actually&nbsp;about curling. The company is working on support for other languages.<br><br>If you want to give the service a try, just head over here and plug a URL into Ayliens API demo.<br><br>All of the data comes back as JSON and the company uses Mashape&nbsp;to sell access to its data.&nbsp;Developers who need to make fewer than 1,000 API calls per day get free access to the service, and those who need more can sign up for paid plans, starting at $199 for 6,000 calls per day. Thats a bit more affordable than what most of Ayliens competitors currently charge, though not by a wide margin.<br><br>Currently, the Aylien team consists of three engineers and none of them hold PhDs. Thats pretty unusual for an NLP startup. While Ghaffari has ties to the academic NLP world, he credits the fact that there are no academics on his team for the pragmatic approach the company takes.<br><br>The next project the company is tackling is a news API&nbsp;for filtering news stories and a number of consumer products that will sit on top of the technologies the team built for its developer services.

After 90 days of mentoring and molding, 10 startups graduated today from Shanghai-based Chinaccelerator. Theyre the seventh batch to emerge from the program since it started in 2009.<br><br>At a crowded demo day in an auditorium at the newly-established ShanghaiTech University, William Bao Bean (pictured below), the Chinaccelerator managing director and SOS Ventures partner, hailed the fact that the current batch is made up of 50 percent female CEOs and 43 percent female founders.<br><br>Here are all 10 multi-national teams that presented to a mix of investors, fellow entrepreneurs, and curious students.<br><br>School Match is an app for prospective students to get one-on-one mentoring sessions. CEO Christina Lau said she could have used such a service when she made the leap from Mexico to UC Berkeley, where she initially struggled to acclimatize. That kind of unease can lead to students dropping out, she explained.<br><br>School Match finds mentors at top schools around the world so that kids and their parents can grill them with questions on anything from the course workload to the best area to live off-campus. It already has 200 mentors on board.<br><br>Its aimed at Chinese students heading overseas. About five million students prep each year to go into higher education in other countries, and about 460,000 get in.<br><br>The startup takes a 15 percent cut of the paid mentoring sessions. Judging by the app screenshots, a session typically costs RMB 200 (US$32) per hour, which is about on a par with what it costs to get English private tutoring in China.<br><br>iCE Angel founder Richard Law started the pitch with a photo of his mother. He explained that she died suddenly out on the street and he wasnt by her side at the end because the emergency services didnt contact him. Thats the kind of situation the service wants to help avoid.<br><br>This is being offered directly to people via an emergency response app, which a first responder can supposedly access (though that raises issues if a phone is locked  and if a paramedic or doctor has no clue what to look for in someones phone). The startups other approach is to form partnerships with travel companies or any business that involves going far from home. That company will then give its customers iCE Angel ID bracelets or cards that will serve as the emergency contact in the event of an accident.<br><br>Another revenue stream comes from services like insurance or senior care packages.<br><br>The core service through the app is free, while iCE Angel charges for the other elements on offer.<br><br>Meet Boutique focuses on boutique hotels in China. Han Dong says that boutique hotels tend to get buried in Chinas popular travel-booking sites, such as Qunar and Ctrip, but the startups app gives them a place to shine and stand out as characterful alternatives to the usual luxury chain hotels.<br><br>Han claimed that his app can get lower prices for boutique hotels for its customers because those businesses appreciate not only the limelight but also the tasteful clientele it brings them.<br><br>GeiLi Giving wants to shake up the way Chinese people give to charities, making charitable campaigns more transparent and Kickstarter-esque while encouraging folks to donate with gamification and a boost of social media virality.<br><br>The current problem is that Chinas rate of charitable giving is one of the lowest in the world, explains co-founder and CEO Elyse Ribbons during her pitch. The startup wants to unlock the giving potential of China, she enthused.<br><br>GeiLi Giving operates as a public account in WeChat, giving it easy access to your digital cash through WeChats wallet.<br><br>The startup runs crowdfunding-style donation drives for pre-vetted charities and NGOs, giving people a clear idea of how much needs to be raised for a specific project. Micro-donations are fine, as low as RMB 10 (US$1.60) to make it as accessible as possible.<br><br>The viral element comes in, Ribbons explains, when people get points for donating and sharing a campaign with their WeChat buddies. That also helps people feel ownership over a campaign, she adds.<br><br>The startup makes money kind of like Kickstarter  by taking a cut of the total raised.<br><br>Ribbons, who hails from the US and speaks fluent Chinese, is using her celebrity contacts from her regular appearances on Beijing TV to get a variety of stars to promote some of the charitable campaigns via WeChat.<br><br>Robin8 is a data-driven platform for brands to connect with bloggers and influencers. Its aimed at the China market, where CEO Miranda Tan says the world of content marketing is hampered by a lack of trust and no clear way of rating a key opinion leader (KOL).<br><br>So the idea behind Robin8 is that it attaches data to a KOL to help brand managers get marketing material out there through the most effective bloggers and reporters. Tans pitch dubbed this a marketplace of KOLs in the manner of Airbnb.<br><br>This sounds ethically problematic if reporters are republishing content marketing-style articles straight from brands, but its not clear if thats what the end result might be. This could equally be a more effective way of pitching press releases to the most relevant bloggers and journalists.<br><br>Tan said the Robin8 platform scans tens of thousands of news articles each day in order to determine who are the influencers in particular areas.<br><br>Specifiko CEO Mark McIntyre reckons that multinational corporations lose a lot of money due to inadequate English proficiency.<br><br>The startup wants to help fix that in one very specific industry  healthcare and pharmaceuticals. Its focusing on Japan and China to give physicians and clinical scientists English courses that cover their industry and day-to-day work in detail. It uses a mix of text and videos. So far there are 2,000 videos and about 82,000 articles in English with human translations in Chinese and Japanese to help people understand the topic at hand.<br><br>The service, which companies pay for, gives management some data on a workers progress with English to help them make decisions related to promotions and pay rises.<br><br>Its set to partner up with major pharma companies like Novartis and Pfizer.<br><br>SXT Learning CEO Ryan J King was a corporate trainer for seven years. Trouble is, the whole corporate training system is broken, he said at the top of his pitch. Those training sessions give too much information in one go  and people tend to fall asleep. Zoned-out office workers have slept in his own training sessions, he admits  and hes even fallen asleep when attending such things himself. He backed that up with photographic evidence.<br><br>A Deloitte study reckons that 90 percent of whats taught at training sessions is forgotten within five minutes, wasting most of the estimated US$160 billion that companies put into those sessions each year.<br><br>SXTs solution, King explained, is to put corporate training into a good-looking app so that people can take in all that info in more manageable chunks. For workers, the training app has quizzes to keep people motivated, and for the bosses it has analytics so peoples progress can be charted.<br><br>Hopefully the app-based model wont mean that workers are expected to do training in their own time, but Kings pitch didnt touch on that issue.<br><br>30 companies are already using SXT, he said.<br><br>Theres no award for startups with fun names, but there ought to be one to reward The Squirrelz. Its a sort of Etsy for upcycled products  but with a huge, Alibaba-sized twist.<br><br>The Squirrelz operates on two levels. To ordinary shoppers, its a marketplace for funky products made out of cast-off items (pictured below); to makers, its a place to source those materials in bulk. The good news for the startup is that it makes commission on both those stages.<br><br>Bunny Yan, the CEO and co-founder, gave the example of a huge batch of medical scrubs that were rejected because they came out in the wrong color. On The Squirrelz, someone turned those into courier bags.<br><br>Major manufacturers benefit by being able to sell off stuff that would otherwise be trashed.<br><br>The startup can help transform a 1kg bundle of cast-off material that cost only US$10 into US$1,000 worth of products that people want to buy, Yan claimed.<br><br>So far, The Squirrelz has just over 40 designers whove created more than 600 products. Its going to start by focusing on China.<br><br>Lots of startups are trying to improve international money transfers so as to stop people getting fleeced by banks or by the god-awful Western Union. BitNexo is one of these, but its doing so for a very specific area  for business deals between China and Latin America.<br><br>Founder Darren Camas  who splits his time between China and Chile  explained in the pitch that the transfers are done via bitcoin, but users never need to touch bitcoin during the process. This means its not technically a bitcoin transfer, which is an important detail for the China market where banks are prohibited from allowing customers to deal in bitcoin.<br><br>The commission it takes is more transparent than the banks and is set at two percent.<br><br>Xiao Dian Bao wants to take the kind of personal communication common between ecommerce merchants and their customers and make it relevant to offline stores.<br><br>The pitch was a bit of a head-scratcher because it sounds like its only the owners of tiny shops whod communicate with customers in person over social media, but then the presentation mentioned partnering with huge chain stores.<br><br>The startup used the English name Shopal in the pitch, but that already belongs to a Japanese startup. Weve used the Chinese name to avoid confusion.<br><br>On the whole, it looks like Chinaccelerator has come out with a nicely diverse and strong batch of super-focused startups who are, thankfully, not doing the same old things that we get tired of seeing at pitch contests (customer loyalty app, anyone?).

<p><b>Sports Video Innovations Built-In Camera Delivers Worlds First, Live-Streaming Footage of Player POV</b></p><p>SHREVEPORT, La. October 28, 2015  <a href="http://www.sportsvideoinnovations.com/" target="_blank">Sports Video Innovations (SVI)</a> announced today that the worlds first live streaming of footage from its built-in video helmet camera debuted during pre-game coverage of the San Francisco  Seattle game, when warm-up action was seen through the eyes of tight end Vernon Davis. The game took place Thursday, Oct. 22, 2015, at Levis® Stadium in Santa Clara, California.</p><p>SVIs patented, built-in video camera technology is both rugged and streamlined enough to be safely integrated within the nose bumper of SchuttVision helmets. The resulting player point-of-view is one of a kind. The technology puts fans in the middle of the action and gives coaches and players a never-before-available view of plays for practice, trainingand now, with the live streaming capabilitythe chance to closely examine strategies and tactics as they happen and from the center of the play.</p><p>The SVI camera built into the SchuttVision helmet is safe and National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment compliant. It can be used by players at any position, including during games. Nearly 30 NCAA and NFL teams have used the helmets. The camera delivers 720p HD video at 30 frames per second, with 2.5 hours of battery life and a removable SD card for media storage.</p><p>Were excited to usher in the next stage of our development in conjunction with last weeks match-up, said Jeremey Jeansonne, SVIs co-founder and CEO. Everyone involved with football has been impressed with our technology. The ability to stream live straight from a players helmet represents another huge leap forward.</p><p>The live streaming footage of Davis warming up was aired on CBS and can be seen here: <a href="https://youtu.be/9ELpvLdBTJs" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/9ELpvLdBTJs</a>.</p><p># # #</p><p><b>About Sports Video Innovations</b></p><p>Sports Video Innovations (SVI) launched in January 2014 to revolutionize the way sporting events are viewed and experienced, starting with football and the SchuttVision helmet. For the first time, a rugged, high-definition video camera fits into the nose bumper of a football helmet to provide the one of a kind players point-of-view that coaches, fans and broadcasters have been seeking. SchuttVision is approved by the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE).</p><p>First football, and then the sporting world! SVI plans on expanding its patented technology into other areas of sports to bring the companys innovative point-of-view camera to baseball, lacrosse and hockey.

<p><b>Three-Month Campaign in Three Cities Generates a Nearly 14% Click-Through Rate and Exponential ROI</b></p><p>Using the <a href="http://www.socialcentiv.com/" title="Link: http://www.socialcentiv.com/">SocialCentiv</a> Twitter marketing application, Room Escape Adventures is taking a direct and personal approach to getting more people in Los Angeles, Dallas and Columbus, Ohio, to take up the challenge of being Trapped in a Room with a Zombiea pulse-pounding adventure designed to get participants minds racing and adrenaline flowing as they try to escape the room or get eaten.<br></p><p>Room Escape Adventures set up the SocialCentiv app to look for people Tweeting about things like bachelor party, date night, birthday party, team, Halloween, zombie and Walking Dead. Relevant Tweets received a real-time, direct @reply with a deal for half-off tickets. For example, when SirMusicalD Tweeted Sometimes when Im bored, I find my way into shows and just appreciate how friggin amazing humans are, Room Escape Adventures tweeted: @SirMusicalD Next time, try us! Escape for an hour w/a zombie, Dustin! Escape for $14, with a link to the half-priced deal.<br></p><p>And because no one faces the zombie room alone, one Tweet can equal up to 12 tickets  which equates to exponential ROI for Room Escape Adventures. Over the course of three months, from July  September 2015, the campaign generated 21,401 impressions1, 928 engagements2 and a nearly 14 percent click-through rate on average in all three cities.</p><p>Almost all of our marketing efforts are focused on social, and we know our 18- to 32-year-old target audience is on Twitter. We found SocialCentiv to be the best way to engage with them at the moment they might be interested in the entertaining experience we offer, says Nicole DaCosta, director of marketing at Bucket List Productions, the company that runs <a href="http://roomescapeadventures.com/">Room Escape Adventures</a> series.<br></p><p>The Tweets that express an immediate need are a growing, yet untapped market according to recent research from Forrester Consulting, <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/think/docs/forrester-moments-that-matter-research-study.pdf"><i>Moments That Matter: Intent-Rich Moments are Critical to Winning Todays Consumer Journey</i></a>. Forresters research defines moments as instances when [customers] reflexively turn to their devices to act on a need to learn, discover, find, or buy something. The study goes on to illustrate that 98 percent of companies arent moments ready, and those that fail to respond to this expectation will rapidly fall behind firms that do respond. However, companies that take steps toward becoming moments ready reap benefits in the form of more profitable ROI in both their mobile investment and overall marketing investment.<br></p><p>In the next phase of the campaign, Room Escape Adventures is expanding its use of SocialCentiv in other cities where it produces Trapped in a Room with a Zombie, including New York City, and will also take full advantage of the October premiere of Season 5 of <i>The Walking Dead</i> as well as Halloween.<br></p><p>Were hoping to capitalize on the spirit of the season and give people a frightful and fun zombie experience, says DaCosta. SocialCentiv is a great asset to help us accomplish our goals as their staff is always checking in with us, tweaking responses, suggesting ways to Tweet, and making sure our campaign is working to help build ticket sales.<br></p><p><b>About SocialCentiv</b><br></p><p>SocialCentiv is a full-service Twitter marketing company that helps companies find new customers on Twitter with their patented software. Using a business keywords and geographic location, SocialCentiv combs Twitter in real time looking for relevant Tweets that express an intent to purchase a product or service. The business can @ reply directly back to potential customers with a customized, personal message and a discount or offer to get them in the door. For example, @JaneDoe Tweets about being really hungry for pizza. A local pizza parlor finds her Tweet using SocialCentiv, and Tweets directly back with a personal message and a coupon for free salad and soda with her pizza at lunch. SocialCentiv has a 34 percent average click through rate, and some industries  like restaurants, hotels and sports marketing  having much higher averages.</p><p>Since May 2013, SocialCentiv has received $12 million in funding.

<p><a>Solis Mammography</a>, is getting an influx of calls from women asking if their mammograms are covered by insurance in light of the American Cancer Societys (ACS) new recommendations announced last week. Solis wants to reassure all women that insurance coverage has not immediately changed, and that its radiologists <a href="http://newsroom.solismammo.com/2015/10/20/215/" title="Link: http://newsroom.solismammo.com/2015/10/20/215/">strongly</a> recommend that women still begin getting an annual mammogram at 40 (unless high risk factors exist which might cause her to start earlier than 40.)</p><p>Solis Mammography, the nations largest independent provider of mammography services, has centers in the Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, Phoenix, Columbus, Ohio, and Greensboro, N.C., markets.<br></p><p>We want the public to know that currently, a standard 2D screening mammogram is covered at 100 percent by almost all healthcare plans, says Connie Oliver, Solis VP of marketing and client relations. Last week, the ACS recommended that women between the ages of 40-44 not get mammograms. This has confused many patients who worry these recommendations give insurance companies the right to deny payment for mammograms to women under 45.<br></p><p>What the community needs to know about the out-of-pocket costs for mammograms, as it stands today:</p><p></p><ul><li>A standard 2D screening mammogram is covered at 100 percent by almost all insurance plans.<br></li><li>3D screening mammograms, also known as tomosynthesis, are 100 percent covered by Medicare and by select major insurance providers including Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas. Coverage by other providers vary by plan and policy. If a 3D mammogram is not covered, out-of-pocket costs at Solis Mammography range between $50 and $100.<br></li><li>As of today, the ACS announcement has not had any impact on mammography coverage by insurance providers. However, that risk does exist in the future if the public and the healthcare community do not speak out. Solis Mammography does everything it can to ensure the insurance landscape does not create an unfavorable financial hardship for women who proactively want to take ownership of their health.<br></li></ul><p></p><p>If there are other specific coverage questions, Solis recommends that women call their health insurance provider.

<p><i>October 28, 2015 (New York, New York)<b>&nbsp;</b></i>&nbsp; Just days around World Food Day and International Chefs Day,&nbsp;<a href="http://thekitchenconnection.org/">KitchenConnection.org</a>&nbsp;launches the second version of its foodie social network where both lay and professional cooks can share pictures, blog posts, and recipes, as well as participate in the platforms signature connections where users can host live video sessions to cook or share tips about food with other users anywhere in the world. Currently, there are representatives from over 100 different countries on the platform, from Fiji to North Korea.&nbsp;</p><p>Users can choose to host these connections for free or paid, and if paid, can donate some or all of the money to Kitchen Connections partner charity, Action Against Hunger, supporting the sites mission:&nbsp;<i>Im eating  youre eating and because were eating together,</i><i>&nbsp;someone else is eating too</i></p><p>Just a year ago, Kitchen Connection launched its invite-only beta version after a pre-launch event in New York City where the Kitchen Connection team showcased a live cooking experience with a French Master Chef from the prestigious chefs association, Maîtres Cuisiniers de France and foodies in Paris.</p><p>The site, which urges members to create a profile where his cooking credentials, languages spoken and interests can all be showcased, is also a place to distinguish users who are members of the prestigious World Chefs organization, which has partnered with Kitchen Connection. Past supporters of the platform include Whole Foods Market Bowery, which sponsored their launch in the past.</p><p>Founder, Earlene Cruz, thought of the venture while studying abroad on a ship through the program Semester at Sea. Right before porting in Ghana, she lost her wallet with all of her money. Her plans to CouchSurf there led her to a home-stay with a family that graciously housed her and fed her for the week that she was in Ghana.

The aim is to connect global foodies through a virtually interactive platform that allows them not only to meet, interact with, and learn from fellow members but also to work together to create meals, sit down together, and ultimately contribute to their global family through the revenue generatedwithout even leaving their homes. Food  its preparation, consumption, and distribution - is the most ubiquitous human experience, which is at the core of the alleviation of global hunger.</p><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p></p><p></p><p><i>Im eating  youre eating </i></p><p></p><p></p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p></p><p></p><p><i>and because were eating together,</i></p><p></p><p></p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p></p><p></p><p><i>someone else is eating too</i></p><p></p><p></p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ###</p><p></p><p></p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p><i></i></p><p><i></i></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><i>Feel good and perform better with green tea caffeine, more electrolytes than a Gatorade, and more vitamins than a Vitamin Water.</i></h3>  <p>NEW YORK, NY -- Athletes and active individuals alike have been relying on synthetically caffeinated energy shots for energy, sugared water for electrolytes, and over-loaded pills for vitamins. Products with multi-million dollar marketing campaigns and athlete endorsements have labeled themselves the only solutions for our performance needs. TRU, Inc. didnt buy it, and their team of athletes and entrepreneurs are bringing startup innovation to nutrition and fitness.</p>  <p>--------</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Innovative nutrition startup, TRU, Inc., will be releasing its first product line, TRUEnergy, through Kickstarter on November 17th (<a href="http://eepurl.com/bDZu3v" target="_blank">sign up for the launch notification</a>). TRUEnergy is a green tea caffeinated sports shot infused with major electrolytes, essential vitamins, and antioxidants. The shot has a citrus flavor with real sweetener. This sports shot is the most functional beverage on the market, ounce for ounce. How? In just less than 2 ounces TRUEnergy has more electrolytes than a Gatorade, more vitamins than a Vitamin Water, and an optimal amount of caffeine for sustainable energy and focus. TRU is disrupting sports nutrition and creating a new class of beverage</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><i>TRUEnergy is, ounce for ounce, the most functional beverage on the market.</i></p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>I experienced major problems as an athlete with sustaining energy over the course of a game, and I needed a solution. While playing pro hockey, guys were experimenting with things like energy shots and coffee. Eventually, theyd shy from the highly caffeinated options because the energy wasnt sustainable. Theyd get the jitters, and theyd crash. TRU, Inc. founder Jack McNamara. To perform at your best, you need that optimal focus point, so we created a better solution by utilizing green tea as the perfect natural stimulant. In addition, athletes need more electrolytes than typical individuals and have deficiencies in specific vitamins, so we added those as well. Antioxidants are an added bonus aiding your body in the recovery process.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><i>Dont regret what you drink, get what you need for now and later.</i></p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>As a student-athlete you need to be focused in and out of the classroom. As a rower wed wake up at 5am for early morning practice, and there were a lot of mornings where guys werent fully awake and focused until theyd gotten into their workout. Its crucial to be at your best from the start, says Robert Avakian.</p>  <p>____________</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Starting with focus and experiencing lasting energy is optimal for competition, workouts, or practice. Additionally, TRU understands the importance of also taking care of your body. In a soccer match youre running upwards of 7 miles. In addition to energy, I needed to have my body prepared. For that type of prolonged competition Ill play better, and with more confidence, knowing my muscles have the electrolytes and vitamins to fight fatigue and cramps, says Ryan Foss-Skiftesvik.</p>  <p>____________</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>At TRUs core is innovation and transparency. In addition to the innovative formula, TRUEnergy is re-inventing the bottle. A minimalists dream, the transparent rectangular design enables versatility for display, and maximizes efficiency for distribution. TRUEnergy is unique and modern, and deserves a memorable bottle rather than the opaque and stumpy standard. Importantly, this attention-commanding bottle will be polyethylene terephthalate - a recyclable plastic.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><i>The transparent rectangular bottle is a minimalists dream.</i></p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The team behind TRUEnergy is made of former college, international, and professional athletes who understand the consumers pain  because its their pain. Now, theyre creating the sustainable solution. TRU, Inc. is going to change the game of nutrition by creating innovative products. No longer will we sacrifice healthy ingredients for desired performance benefits. Simply, youll feel good and perform better.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><b>About TRU, Inc.</b></p>  <p>TRU is a NYC based nutrition startup participating in FOOD-X, an SOSV backed international accelerator. TRUEnergy Sports Shot, TRUs first product, will launch through Kickstarter on November 17th at 9am EST. <a href="http://eepurl.com/bDZu3v" target="_blank">Sign up for the launch notification</a>.</p><blockquote><h3></h3></blockquote>
<div>Despite or because of all the conveniences of modern industrial societies, what we are eating is damaging the health of our populations and of our agricultural systems. Much of modern medicine is focused on treating diet-related diseases, which have become widespread and pervasive.</div><br>Environmental issues related to industrial agricultural systems are also of serious concern, not only to us but to future generations. We are twice as large and are living twice as long as compared to traditional agrarian societies, but we are not that much happier or healthier. Food needs revolution.<br><br>FOOD-X is taking on these radical challenges by bringing together markets and education, combining entrepreneurship, peer learning, mentor coaching, and financial leverage. Trial and error, essential to entrepreneurship, will be experienced through multiple cycles in a very condensed period of time, accelerating a year of progress into 14 weeks. Our network of eight SOSV accelerators, graduating nearly 100 companies a year, have shown that 3 out of 4 companies change their names, and more than half of companies change their product radically during the course of our programs. Consequently, success rates for these companies are much higher than average  companies achieve higher revenue, companies achieve funding, and companies achieve product/market fit going through accelerators.<br><br>Watch FOOD-X Founder Shen Tong talk about The Food Movement at TEDx:<div><div><iframe width="560px" height="315px" class="embed-responsive-item" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/TvNBXbla_10" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><br></div>
WASHINGTON &nbsp;The Obama administration has authorized the deployment&nbsp;of&nbsp;U.S. military advisers into&nbsp;Syria&nbsp;in a significant expansion of the U.S. fight against the Islamic State, the White House said Friday.<br><br>President Obama approved&nbsp;a contingent of no more than 50 special operations forces to enter northern Syria where they will work with local rebels fighting the Islamic State.<br><br>The move&nbsp;reflects&nbsp;concerns that the fight&nbsp;against the militants in Iraq and Syria has stalled and needs to be reinvigorated.<br><br>The deployment is open-ended, White House spokesman Josh&nbsp;Earnest said, and future moves will be based on a constant assessment.&nbsp;"This is not a short-term proposition," he said.<br><br>Administration officials insist that the move does not alter the basic strategy, which is to support local forces in the fight against the Islamic State and avoid the use of conventional American&nbsp;ground troops.<br><br>Obama has been mindful of "mission creep," the steady escalation of U.S. involvement that would draw America deeper into a Middle East war.<br><br>"I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria  I will not pursue an open-ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan," Obama said in 2013.<br><br>Dispatching U.S. Special Operations advisers is not the same as conventional military forces, but it heightens the risk for American troops and places them closer to combat. A U.S. soldier, Master Sgt. Joshua Wheeler, died last week while supporting a Kurdish raid that successfully freed 70 prisoners from an Islamic State prison in Iraq.<br><br>"They will not be in a combat mission," Earnest said.<br><br>The new advisers in Syria will support opposition forces battling the Islamic State there. U.S. aircraft have supported Kurdish forces in northern Syria in battles against the Islamic State.<br><br>The Pentagon recently began supporting an Arab coalition in Syria, saying they were currently engaged in operations against the Islamic State. The force of about 5,000 rebels are in&nbsp;a position to put pressure on militants in Raqqa, the defacto Islamic State capital in Syria,&nbsp;which would represent a new front in the war.<br><br>Special Operations forces can help train and coordinate rebel forces and better coordinate airstrikes from the U.S.-led coalition.<br><br>The administration has also authorized the deployment of A-10s, an aircraft that is effective in providing close support to ground troops, to Turkey where they will be used in the war against the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIL or ISIS.<br><br>The administration says it&nbsp;will discuss with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi the establishment of a special operations force that could target Islamic State leaders.<br><br>Michael Knights, an analyst with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said the administration has been feeling pressure from some of its allies in the region to speed up the pace of operations against the Islamic State.<br><br>"The White House's previous attitude is this is a three- or four-year conflict," Knights said. "Everybody else is saying, 'We're in a hurry.'"
<p>i am looking forward to the new year.</p>

Someone in the city is always looking for him, and it is only a matter of time before he will appear again to fight for what is left of reality itself. </blockquote><p></p><p><b><i><br></i></b></p><h3>	<b><i></i>Synopsis<i></i></b></h3><p>The Codename: Rave Webseries is a foray into the vast cast of characters that make up the population of Replay City.  The Codename: Rave webseries begins with Exordium, a seven part prologue to the Codename: Rave universe. &nbsp; Starting with the chapter Apocolyic Night, each chapter will give readers a chance to meet the key players in the Codename: Rave Universe. &nbsp; With enough support and time to build a fanbase over the course of the year, The Codename: Rave team plans to run other stories and expand the universe.<br></p><h3><b><br></b></h3><h3><b>Chapters</b></h3><p>	<b><i>Apocolyic Night</i></b></p><p>The initial chapter of Exordium opens with a rave taking place in a Warehouse in Replay City.  We don't see The Operator spinning on this night, because each of the stories is designed to build to our first sight of him in Chapter 6 and 7 Build and Replay City.  Raves thrown in the warehouse have rooms that are constantly shifting and changing.  One of these rooms is known as the Death Diva Room, and serves as a meeting place for Tabitha Scarnage and her guests in Replay City.  Tabitha is a drug dealing witch, who is now attempting to bring her associates from the Shadow Fallacy realm to Replay City to expand her control of the city.  She plans to do so by selling powerful drugs known as Triggers, which have various affects on the powers each of the citizens in replay City already has.  Also at the table are the other members of the Suffermoore Society Katiyana, Jelan Bex, and Ala Blight.  They are discussing the differences between their world in the Shadow Fallacy and the real world, which is Replay City.  This takes place years before the other chapters, and is when Tabitha and the Suffermoore society were still on speaking terms.  Tabitha is telling them of her plan to use a powerful new source of power known as Beyond and her Trigger drugs to give them an edge of the magic they are used to using.  In the middle of their conversation, the Suffermoore society meeting is interrupted by members of The Fit, a faction of energy based weapon users in the city.  They want to cut Tabitha out of the drug operation she built in Replay City.  She makes an example out of all of them by calling to Katiyana to use her control of Nightmares to paralyze them with fear.  Tabitha uses this opportunity to show off her ability to drain emotions from some of the Fit as well and the chapter ends.</p><p><br></p><p>	<b><i>Sourcerers</i></b></p><p>The second chapter of Exordium explores the elemental users in Replay City known as the Sourcerers.  It picks up with a flashback of Alyssa Ferno carrying Raquel Vega out of Haze hospital.  As it continues, the chapter explains the Sourcerers and their search for the pieces required to build The Source, which will allow them to stabilize the Beyond in their bodies and help them survive in the city as a faction.  This chapter also discusses the issue that The Operator is hard to find and may be the key to assembling the Source. &nbsp; The chapter ends when Tabitha murders everyone in a board meeting at the pharmaceutical corporation that allows her to manufacture her legal drugs and do her research. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>	<b><i>Serengeti</i></b></p><p>The third chapter of Exordium picks up some hours after the timeframe Sourcerers takes place in and shows the same board that was killed by Tabitha in the previous chapter.  That board was faced with an issue threatening the city, a man known as Dark Pixel.  Ala, one of the Suffermoore Society from the first chapter is attempting to explain the severity of Dark Pixel's presence and how he is seeking out powerful people in cities around the world to kill.  She is in the middle of explaining how Replay City is next, when Tabitha comes in to the meeting.  When Tabitha gets there she begins to attack Ala, we discover the board meeting members are holograms that Tabitha is using to influence Dark Pixel, who did not know she had previously killed the board members earlier.  Ala makes it out of the building to dialog with Monica Sonance, the woman who creates The Operator's technology from his ideas.  We see her workshop, which shows of The Operator's technology for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>	<b><i>Old Wounds Heal in Grime</i></b></p><p>The fourth chapter of Exordium is a flashback to Raquel Vega's time in the hospital after she was attacked by a Fit and Fury and paralyzed from the waist down.  The flashback ends when Otieno gets Raquel's attention to let her know that he sees the two men that attacked her and asks if she recognizes them in the arcade. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>	<b><i>Darkness in Them</i></b></p><p>The fifth chapter of Exordium features Otieno, on one of the Operator's closest friends.  He takes a long ride throughout Replay City and is approached by a mysterious figure.  He wants to follow him and learn of what he is doing in the city, but he has to focus.  He is on short time and must meet Raquel at A.C., the arcade where Raquel is waiting ready to shoot intruders. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>	<b><i>Build</i></b></p><p>The sixth chapter of Exordium picks up where Darkness In Them left off and provides explanation from the Operator about how he has survived by training in a Virtual Reality simulator linked to Reality known as the Build.  The chapter ends when an individual tries to enter the build with a special suitcase that contains a single CONTINUE, which allows the user to come back to life at the price of the lives of everyone in an entire city.  Raquel and Otieno are supposed to guard this case with their lives, and since it is stolen, they must travel back in to the simulator with {OP} to get it back.<b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><br></p><p><b><i>	Replay City</i></b></p><p>The seventh chapter of Exordium features The Operator out in the streets of Replay City, describing how the Build extended to the city and formed a contract caste system that relies on a glitched application to determine if someone can accept black market style requests for hits, attacks, assassinations, and other unsavory services.</p><p><br></p><h3>	<b>Character Descriptions</b></h3><p><b><i><br></i></b></p><p><b><i>T</i></b><b><i>he Operator</i></b></p><p>A man known only as The Operator is left to survive in a city full 	of individuals given amazing superpowers by way of an essence most know as 	Beyond.

I've always written stories here and there, but this one kept calling out to me over the last 15 years.  I developed it because before the internet took on the power that it did, it was very difficult to make people aware of people that were different from the same.  In the 80's and 90's if you were lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, black, asian, latino, hispannic, overweight, nerdy...different...you had no place in the world according to the mainstream.  I took the name the Broken Flow both to run against that grain again within comics and tell a story where people from all walks of life fit because they were different and to celebrate it.  There was no other place that did that better than Warehouse parties.  That framework fit very well into the survival style stories I'd always wanted to see instead of typical superhero books.  The aftermath is what you see before you."</blockquote><p></p><p><br></p><h3><b>Artist Bios</b></h3><p><b>Dino Agor- Art Director, Penciler</b><br></p><p>	A Filipino artist, graduated as Bachelor of Science in Nursing, practiced his profession 	for 5 years.

<p><i>November 3, 2015 (New York, New York)<b>&nbsp;</b></i>&nbsp; Just days around World Food Day and International Chefs Day,&nbsp;<a href="http://thekitchenconnection.org/">KitchenConnection.org</a>&nbsp;launches the second version of its foodie social network where both lay and professional cooks can share pictures, blog posts, and recipes, as well as participate in the platforms signature connections where users can host live video sessions to cook or share tips about food with other users anywhere in the world. Currently, there are representatives from over 100 different countries on the platform, from Fiji to North Korea.&nbsp;</p><p>Users can choose to host these connections for free or paid, and if paid, can donate some or all of the money to Kitchen Connections partner charity, Action Against Hunger, supporting the sites mission:&nbsp;<i>Im eating  youre eating and because were eating together,</i><i>&nbsp;someone else is eating too</i></p><p>Just a year ago, Kitchen Connection launched its invite-only beta version after a pre-launch event in New York City where the Kitchen Connection team showcased a live cooking experience with a French Master Chef from the prestigious chefs association, Maîtres Cuisiniers de France and foodies in Paris.</p><p>The site, which urges members to create a profile where his cooking credentials, languages spoken and interests can all be showcased, is also a place to distinguish users who are members of the prestigious World Chefs organization, which has partnered with Kitchen Connection. Past supporters of the platform include Whole Foods Market Bowery, which sponsored their launch in the past.</p><p>Founder, Earlene Cruz, thought of the venture while studying abroad on a ship through the program Semester at Sea. Right before porting in Ghana, she lost her wallet with all of her money. Her plans to CouchSurf there led her to a home-stay with a family that graciously housed her and fed her for the week that she was in Ghana. Eating the delicious red-red stew with her hands on their living room floor led her to want to virtually recreate the experience, hence the premise for Kitchen Connection.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a></a>Here is the sites promotional video:&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/m4TqVE14OMc">https://youtu.be/m4TqVE14OMc</a></p><div><br></div><p>ABOUT Kitchen Connection</p><p><a href="http://www.KitchenConnection.org">www.KitchenConnection.org</a></p><p>Where Food Links the World"</p><p>The mission of Kitchen Connection is to alleviate global hunger by creating a hub for recipe exchange, education, and global connection through food. The aim is to connect global foodies through a virtually interactive platform that allows them not only to meet, interact with, and learn from fellow members but also to work together to create meals, sit down together, and ultimately contribute to their global family through the revenue generatedwithout even leaving their homes. Food  its preparation, consumption, and distribution - is the most ubiquitous human experience, which is at the core of the alleviation of global hunger.</p><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p></p><p></p><p><i>Im eating  youre eating </i></p><p></p><p></p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p></p><p></p><p><i>and because were eating together,</i></p><p></p><p></p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p></p><p></p><p><i>someone else is eating too</i></p><p></p><p></p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ###</p><p></p><p></p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p><i></i></p><p><i></i></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>  </p><p>In response to the two prong strategy to fight digital ad fraud by the Trustworthy Accountability Group (TAG), Jay Friedman, COO at Goodway Group states:<br><br>Goodway Group is a part of the IAB TAG and thus has an innate understanding of the value of trustworthy ecosystems. However, by our estimation, a plan that costs hundreds or thousands of parties $10,000 each isnt necessarily a sound or effective strategy in fighting digital ad fraud.</p><p><br>Most industry analysts agree that the biggest challenge in digital ad fraud currently comes from bot traffic. The $10k TAG certification doesnt solve this issue and claiming to address it by verifying payment seems functionally problematic. To illustrate my point, suppose Im the owner of a legitimate fan blog about the Green Bay Packers, boasting over 50,000 visitors a month, yet Im an expat living in Russia. How can it be determined with accuracy that my blog is legitimate? Because lots of bot traffic comes from Eastern Europe, does that eliminate my blogs legitimacy solely based on my location? Taking it a step further, what if, as the owner of the blog, I cant afford to pay the $10,000 for certification?</p><p>  </p><p>Solving the problem of bot traffic should be our No. 1 priority, however this plan either places a million small publishers at a severe disadvantageor even worseout of business altogether. Conversely, we know that lots of bots are nothing more than spoofed users. In solving this, are we going to put CAPTCHA requirements on every page of the World Wide Web just to make sure its a real user who should be viewing an ad? User certification seems to be the most important factor in play, but its next to impossible to truly verify. And this is why it remains a pressing problem throughout the industry.</p><p>  </p><p>Goodway Group is a leading managed-services programmatic partner to local, regional and Fortune 500 brand agencies. Bootstrapped and 100 percent privately owned since 1929, Goodway moved into the programmatic digital media space in 2006 to continue its rich history of tackling complex local and regional campaign executions with data science-driven targeting and support services to make achieving success easy for agency clients.

<div><p>Those fucking refs! </p><p>Slouched in a locker room reeking of sweat in Trondheim, Norway, I sat there numb. Something that had dominated almost a quarter century of my life had abruptly ended in a split second, and it was all my fault.</p><p>It was overtime in Game 4 of the Get-Legaen playoffs and we were trailing 3-0 in the series against the Stavanger Oilers, the best and wealthiest team in the league. To say that Rosenborg IHK was an underdog would be an understatement, but that night we had a chance.</p><p>Thanks to a questionable call, I put my fate in the hands of the enemy. It couldnt have been more anti-climactic. I had to sit on the bench and watch some kid skate down the rink like Charlie Conway on a penalty shot and seal my fate. I knew my career would eventually end, but I never thought it would be like this.</p><p><img width="640" alt="" src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_800_800/AAEAAQAAAAAAAARRAAAAJGJmYWU2MTkxLWY4MDEtNDVmZS1hZWEwLTYwNjRiYTg3NDIxNw.jpg" height="453"></p><p>What the hell do I do now?</p><p>It was as if my girlfriend of almost 25 years had just broken up with me, and I had to re-enter the dating pool. The only problem was I didnt know how to date and I needed a new devotion - software sales. In 2015, Forbes had VMTurbo at the #52 spot of the most promising companies. I lasted 2 weeks and 3.5 days.</p><p>Every single day I would wake up at 5 am, jump on the T, pretend I was still an athlete for 30 minutes at Boston Sports Club, and then cold call CTOs until 6pm. The competition and effort among my colleagues within the office was fierce and familiar, and I had the utmost respect for every single person in the office. Unlike hockey where I mastered my skill over decades of dedication, I had to learn this skill set in a week. This lack of preparation turned a once tough hockey player into a scared kid on his first day of school.</p><p>Take me off your list!</p><p>Hands sweating and heart pounding, every time I made a dial, I thought I was going into cardiac arrest. Angry frustrated people, who hated their jobs, would demand me to remove them from our list. I went from getting hit through the boards on the ice to getting verbally assaulted by random people on a daily basis. At least in hockey you can take a cold tub, but for this, I had yet to find a remedy for my damaged self-esteem and ego.</p><p>After getting home at around 10pm one night, my mother asked how my day went (yes, I was a 25 year old former pro athlete living at home with my parents). After giving my pitch she replied, I would hang up on you too. I had walked into that job cocky and expecting a big paycheck; however, I walked out with a reality check.</p><p>Entrepreneur or unemployed?</p><p>At that moment, I decided that I was never going to have a boss again, and that I was going to define my own path. I hated school, despised the 9-5, and was not a fan of authority. With grad school, another corporate job or having a boss out of the question, I only had one choice: channel my passion towards entrepreneurship.</p><p>Throughout my young life, I have always had two passions. One included blades and sticks while the other included imagination and innovation. For as long as I can remember, inventors have intrigued me. My heroes are guys like Richard Branson and Elon Musk. These innovators are self-made men who put everything on the line in order to bring their crazy ideas to life. Much like athletes, they are driven by a never say die attitude and a work ethic that borders obsession. I dreamed of being the next great one.</p><p><img width="600" alt="" src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_800_800/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAPGAAAAJGE0OWEzOWI2LTA1MWQtNGU5NC1hZDI1LWEyMWMxMzc3NmQ1OA.png" height="471"></p><p>&nbsp;We have a problem.</p><p>Ever since high school, I had kept a list of my ideas in my dads office that I believed had some potential. One concept stood out among the rest. It was an idea that could merge my two passions of athletics and entrepreneurship.</p><p>As an athlete, I noticed teammates would drink coffee, gels, and energy shots before games to boost focus, however they would also complain about the jitters and crashes. In addition, these guys would drink watered down sports drinks and lugged around briefcases full of vitamins. I knew there had to be a better way.</p><p>Its all about the guy next to you.</p><p>As any real entrepreneur knows, an idea is just an idea. It all comes down to execution and putting thought into action. After my short stint in sales, I decided it was time to take my chance. After getting shut down by dozens of accelerators, I realized I needed a team, so I reached out to a former Belmont Hill classmate and fellow entrepreneur, Robert Avakian. He was a former division 1 rower at Boston University and had previously started a chemical adhesives company. He believed in the mission and jumped on board as the CMO.</p><p>Our first stop was Startup52. I figured an accelerator essentially meant that we were going to accelerate to becoming millionaires. I was wrong. It was a pilot accelerator in NYC that gave us a great opportunity to go at the business full-time. Without funding, we lived in Harlem and still had to rely on personal savings. I slept on the couch, and Robert slept on a mattress on the floor. With no air conditioning for July and August, the living situation was less than optimal, but with their help, we still pushed forward.</p><p>Living at the office.</p><p>With the accelerator coming to a close and the business driving my personal funds to empty, we needed investment badly. With a stroke of luck, we got a message from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.food-x.com/cohort-iii-fall-2015/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Food-X</a>, a premier international food &amp; beverage accelerator in NYC. I had actually applied to their second cohort, but was denied. Thankfully, they kept us in the system. After an awesome meeting with their founders, we were accepted into the program and secured a small investment from their VC fund,&nbsp;<a href="https://sosv.com/food-x-announces-its-third-cohort/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOSV</a>.</p><p>After being accepted, we decided it was time to strengthen team TRU. Continuing with our mantra for athletes by athletes, we brought on Ryan Foss-Skiftesvik, a current Fordham University senior and former IMG Academy soccer player. He was previously a part of a beverage company and had startup experience. We also brought on three part-time team members: Mathias Kaufmann, Kara Kearns, and Raymond McSpirit.</p><p>Upon arrival, reality hit. As we walked through the open floor office in the financial district of NYC, we noticed we were no longer in the minor leagues.

<p>               <b>Shes Trained to Heel So He Can Heal</b>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br></p><p>CARROLLTON, TX (Nov. 5, 2015) <a href="http://www.OperationKindness.org">Operation Kindness</a>, the original and largest no-kill animal shelter in North Texas, and the North Texas Chapter of Pets for Vets are training shelter dogs to become companions for North Texas military veterans experiencing post-traumatic stress issues.<br></p><p>At no cost to the veteran, shelter dogs are vetted, matched and then professionally trained to fit into the veterans lifestyle. Both the veteran and the animal receive training for the lifetime of the dog.</p><p>After serving in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, North Texas Marine Steven Osteen sometimes experiences feelings of anxiety due to post-traumatic stress disorder. To help keep calm when these feelings arise, Steve decided to apply for a companion animal through the Pets for Vets program. Steve was instantly selected and then connected with a professional trainer from Operation Kindness to discuss what type of companion dog would appropriately fit his needs, lifestyle and personality. After meeting with Steve, it was apparent he would need a dog that would be calm and comfortable in social situations.</p><p>This is where longtime volunteer and foster parent for Operation Kindness, Debra Knight, comes into play. She began fostering Hazel, a 3-year-old retriever mix. What she thought would be a short, two-week stay evolved into a very successful three-month companion training program. In order to become a companion animal, dogs are required to take tests to assess their social skills, ability to be trained, handling and reactivity, anxiety triggers and house manners. Only 2 percent of shelter animals meet these requirements. Hazel, however, scored an almost perfect score of 90 percent.</p><p>Each week Debra met with Amber Jester, a certified behavior specialist and animal trainer at Operation Kindness. Together they created the curriculum to prepare Hazel for becoming a companion. Hazel quickly learned how to sit and many other important behaviors to help her future veteran companion.</p><p>Fostering for Pets for Vets was a great experience for me. You know it is the right thing to do when everybody wins, said Debra. The veteran got a companion animal, a shelter dog got a home, my dogs got a stronger pack leader, and I got a rich experience in training with the mentoring and guidance of a professional trainer.</p><p>Today, almost three months after her initial training, Hazel accompanies Steve wherever he goes including trips to the zoo, circus, grocery store and many more adventures. In crowded situations, Steve is able to focus all of his attention on Hazel  relieving feelings of anxiety which helps keep him calm. Steve credits Hazels assistance with helping him save his life and his marriage.</p><p>As part of the program, Operation Kindness also provides the veteran with supplies and equipment such as a crate, food and water bowls, and grooming supplies to help the dog and owner start their new life together. Throughout the process, the trainer provides ongoing support to the veteran and continues to make home visits to assist with training techniques. All of this is done at no cost to the veteran.</p><p>Operation Kindness Pets for Vets program needs more volunteers willing to foster and train dogs for veterans. If you would like to volunteer, or know a veteran who could benefit from this program, please contact Tomi Tucker at <a href="mailto:ttucker@operationkindness.org">ttucker@operationkindness.org</a> or visit <a href="http://www.operationkindness.org/opk/homepage/pets-for-vets/">http://www.operationkindness.org/opk/homepage/pets-for-vets/</a> for more information.</p><p>Pets for Vets is a nonprofit organization founded by animal trainer Clarissa Black. The national organization has 22 chapters in 18 states, two of which are in Texas  in the Houston and North Texas areas. Operation Kindness, the North Texas chapter, is the first animal shelter nationwide to be granted chapter status.

I was poking around Amazon a while back and saw an 85-inch Samsung TV that cost $45,000. Just for fun I checked out the reviews and saw these gems:<br><br>"I was going to fund my daughters [sic.] wedding in Hawaii, but I figured this Samsung TV would last much longer." -- Jordan<br><br>"The black levels and color depth on this TV are pretty good for the price. However, the small screen size is a deal breaker. I recommend buying an IMAX theater instead." --&nbsp;David<br><br>If you haven't run across them before, there's a long tradition of users leaving funny fake reviews on odd or extravagant products on Amazon.com. Here are some of the funniest ones I've found.<br><br>Unfortunately, not all fake reviews are hilarious. Marketing firms often pay people to leave positive reviews on major seller sites to boost sales. In fact, Amazon just sued more than 1,000 people who were paid to post fake five-star reviews on products.<br><br>Even legitimate reviews might be unhelpful. Maybe the reviewer went overboard with unwarranted praise or criticism. You don't want to base your purchasing decision on faulty information. We're going to look at how you can tell the difference between a real, helpful review and a fake or unhelpful one.<br><br>Before we go into the signs, however, there's one general rule I need to mention. You should never base a buying decision off of only one online review, whether it's positive or negative.<br><br>Look around the shopping site you're on, and other shopping sites or online sources, for more reviews. Additional reviews will help you get a picture of what the product is really like. Also, don't just go by star ratings because every reviewer has different things they consider pros and cons.<br><br>Here's an example: Looking at reviews for a printer recently, some people gave it five stars and mentioned that it used ink a little fast but print quality was great. Other people gave it one star and said print quality was great but it burned through ink. It's the same information from completely different viewpoints. So, don't just skim.<br><br>OK, now for the signs of fake or unhelpful reviews.<br><br>Facts are important in a review. When you're writing your own reviews, staying factual can protect you from a lawsuit. However, factual tips are also more useful for everyone.<br><br>If you see a string of reviews that are heavy on the adjectives ("Amazing!" "Fantastic!" "Life-changing!") and light on facts, skip them. You're looking for reviews that tell you what specific features the reviewer found that make it a good, or bad, product.<br><br>In fact, it often saves time to skip 5-star reviews and look at the 4-star and 1-star reviews to see what negatives people mention. Again, however, any negatives need to be backed up with facts. "It was terrible" tells you a lot less than, "It worked fine for three weeks and then the power button fell off."<br><br>On the other end of the spectrum, you might find reviews that have too many facts with no conclusions. It might just be a list of product features with no information about how the product impacted the reviewer. That's a sign the reviewer is just copying the features list and possibly doesn't actually own the product.<br><br>Amazon does have a "verified purchase" tag on some reviews to show that the person did in fact buy the product. Be sure to look for that when you're considering reviews on Amazon.<br><br>There have been plenty of times I've been researching a product and started noticing a similarity in the reviews across several websites. In one case, nearly every review was posted on the same day. That's certainly a red flag, and the fact that none of the reviews was very factual was just the icing.<br><br>For another product, every positive review I found online was the same exact review. The author's name was even the same on every site. That's not a coincidence, that's just plain lazy on some marketer's part.<br><br>Reading through a string of reviews on Amazon, you might notice a whole collection that uses similar word groupings and writing style. That's usually a warning flag as well. It means the reviewers are either copying the manufacturer's information or the same person wrote them all.<br><br>Watch out for product reviews from new accounts or new websites. True, the person might have created the account just to buy that product, but some of the reviews should be from long-time members of the site.<br><br>Most shopping sites, such as Amazon, let you see the profile of the person leaving the review. That way, you can see what they've reviewed in the past. Find out what your Amazon profile reveals about you and how to take control of it.<br><br>You might find the person has reviewed hundreds of widely dissimilar products, which gives them a more credibility than someone who's only reviewed a few items from the same manufacturer. It helps, too, if some of those reviews had factual criticisms.<br><br>The only thing worse than tons of suspicious reviews is very few reviews. You're left with no way to make comparisons. At that point, every review becomes suspicious, especially if they only appear in out-of-the-way blogs and websites.<br><br>For example, there might be a "too-good-to-be-true" tech product for sale that doesn't have a review, or even a mention, on any reputable tech site. Or you might have to visit page 10 of Google's search results to even find a review of the product you're after.<br><br>In those cases, give it a miss. You're better off buying a competitor that has more reviews, or just not buying that type of product entirely.<br><br>On the Kim Komando Show, the nation's largest weekend radio talk show, Kim takes calls and dispenses advice on today's digital lifestyle, from smartphones and tablets to online privacy and data hacks.

SAN FRANCISCO&nbsp;&nbsp;Twitter's senior vice president of engineering&nbsp;Alex Roetter has&nbsp;pledged "faster progress" after an African American engineer publicly criticized the&nbsp;company's&nbsp;efforts to advance diversity.<br><br>The social media service&nbsp;gave voice to the&nbsp;Ferguson protests&nbsp;and empowered the Black Lives Matter&nbsp;movement, yet the company&nbsp;has a bleak&nbsp;record of hiring and retaining African Americans and Hispanics.<br><br>Leslie Miley, an engineering manager laid off last month when the company cut 8% of its workforce, blasted Twitter for its&nbsp;lack of diversity and inclusive work culture&nbsp;in a&nbsp;Medium post&nbsp;this week.&nbsp;Miley&nbsp;wrote&nbsp;that a "particularly low moment" came when Twitter's&nbsp;engineering chief told him:&nbsp;"Diversity&nbsp;is important, but we won't lower the bar."<br><br>He also said the engineering chief proposed classifying&nbsp;the ethnicity of potential job candidates by last name.<br><br>Miley did not name Roetter. But in his response, Roetter acknowledged that Miley was referring to him.<br><br>"I want Twitter to be a place where all employees feel comfortable raising questions about diversity," Roetter wrote. "That hasnt always been the case, which is unacceptable. The comments attributed to me arent an accurate or complete facsimile, but they conveyed a meaning that was very far from what I intended, which means I did a poor job communicating. That resulted in unnecessary pain and confusion, for which I am truly sorry. We all want the same results  stronger representation of underrepresented minorities at all levels within Twitter."<br><br>Miley, who declined to sign a non-disparagement agreement so he could speak publicly about his experiences at Twitter, did not have an immediate comment. But he responded to Roetter on Medium: "Thank you for this well thought out post. I applaud Twitter for always striving to be a better place."<br><br>Miley's criticism of Twitter's track record on diversity struck a national nerve, generating headlines and&nbsp;drawing&nbsp;renewed scrutiny of the social media service.<br><br>Blacks, Hispanics and Asian-Americans account for 41% of U.S. users, making Twitter more racially diverse than any other social network, including Facebook. As a publicly traded company, Twitter has capitalized on the diversity of its users to attract advertising from major brands that want to target those groups.<br><br>Twitter is especially popular among African-Americans. More than a quarter of black Internet users&nbsp;in the U.S. are on Twitter, a rate higher than other ethnic groups, according to a 2013 study by the&nbsp;Pew Research Center. And "Black Twitter"  the flow of conversation about issues that matter to this online community  has become a cultural force capable of influencing the national dialogue and the course of events.<br><br>Yet African Americans make up a tiny percentage of Twitter's U.S. workforce. And, according to Twitter's most recent diversity figures, the company&nbsp;no longer has any underrepresented minorities in leadership roles in the USA, a decline from 4% last year.<br><br>In August, Twitter publicly announced those goals which include increasing the percentage of its staffers who are underrepresented minorities to 11%, the number of minorities in tech roles to 9% and leadership roles to 6% in 2016.<br><br>Rev. Jesse Jackson told USA TODAY on Wednesday he has "grave concerns" that the recent layoffs at Twitter disproportionately affected African&nbsp;Americans and Hispanics, and he has asked CEO&nbsp;Jack Dorsey to publicly release "a specific accounting."<br><br>"Ive learned a lot this week," Roetter wrote. "We as a company are working to address our blind spots swiftly to build a Twitter that will make our employees and people who use our services proud."
<p>As a part of the World Entrepreneurship Forum (WEnF) 2015, the second Lions Den, an entrepreneurship challenge, was successfully held in Hangzhou on Oct 21, 2015. </p><p>Four challengers pitched their business plans in an exhilarating five-minute, demonstrating their market acumen. After a global search and strict selection, Wei Wei, founder of Global Solutions Localized and Professor Mark Greeven, in collaboration with the Four Lions, have selected four promising young ventures. These four entrepreneurs all aim to offer solutions to industrial or social problems and satisfy consumer needs, including energy saving, construction management, diet management and safety of bus transportation. The Four Lions this year include Baybars Altuntas, the deputy of EBAN (European Business Angel Network) and serial entrepreneur, Paulo Andrez, honorary president of EBAN and serial business angel, Cheng Houbo, founder of Shenzhen Oriental Fortune Capital and Forbes China best investor for consecutive years, and Manoj Sharma, CEO of Singapore Action Community for Entrepreneurship. The Lions proposed critical questions and provided pragmatic recommendations for challengers.</p><p>Ted, the first challenger and the founder of Evercomm from Singapore, stressed the complexity in energy consumption management in factories and large campuses, and provides solutions that can help managers to make decisions to save energy cost based on the real-time data. Ted also told the investors that his main purpose in Lions Den is to seek network rather than funding. This is one fantastic example for other entrepreneurs said judge Paulo Andrez, commending on Teds emphasis on networking and expanding of the market rather than just begging for money to burn..</p><p>African entrepreneur Sidy Kebe aims to provide a B2B platform, connecting constructers with global suppliers, in consideration that it has been uneasy for African constructers to purchase and import appropriate materials and equipment. He exhibited the core competitiveness of his venture in terms of existing relations and experience while the judges were looking for first achievements and some real revenues and profits.</p><p>Apart from business ideas related to heavy industry, entrepreneurs also focus on daily life and social well-being. As a local entrepreneur, Zhang Kingsun offered Tao Tie, a device made of magnets to turn the ordinary refrigerator into a smart one. With some simple clicks, the magnetic devices can track food consumption and inform users with a real-time cooking guide and nutrient analysis. As interesting as the idea is, judges challenged him with the plans feasibility and potential market size. Kingsun, nevertheless, showed prowess and is determined to make it happen, if only for solving his own daily refrigerator stocking problems.</p><p>Malaysian entrepreneur Shi Jin aims to make public transport safer. His APP Traquer tracks buses and prevents road accidents. Judges critiqued that the APP is more socially influential than profitable and such comments put every participant in the forum to ponder how a social enterprise project make a profit.</p><p>                </p><p>In the end of the Challenge, Manoj Sharma shared with challengers his seven criteria he uses when considering if a business plan is worth investing, i.e. the idea, market size, expertise, team, revenue, competitive advantage and the potential to innovate the business model. Paulo Andrez encourage more women to participate in the challenge and called for women Lion in the next Lion Den. Even though all the ventures are winners, only one can be the real winner. Both the Lions and the deciding public voted for Ted with his venture Evercomm. Now let the market decide.</p>

<p><i>Named the 2016 Beneficiary of Americas Future Series and Opens an Internal Veterans Service Organization (VSO) Resource Center</i></p><p>DALLAS, TX (Nov. 9, 2015)  <a href="http://www.transformanceusa.org" target="_blank">Transformance, Inc.</a>, formerly Consumer Credit Counseling Service (CCCS) of Greater Dallas, has announced plans to expand and extend their financial literacy outreach programs to U.S. veterans. Transformance was named the 2016 nonprofit beneficiary of the Americas Future Series. Americas Future Series is a nonpartisan organization that hosts numerous annual events featuring prominent business, military, government and educational thought leaders. Their intent is to elevate awareness and dialogue on the issues affecting the stature of the United States global competitiveness in the key areas of health care, energy, education, the economy, the environment, national security, cybersecurity and technology/innovation.<br></p><p>Rich Lakers, CEO of Americas Future Series, said, We fully support the vision of Transformance to foster financially accountable and sustainable communities across America through its transformational learning systems. To date, AFS has raised over $2,000,000 for causes worldwide. Transformance, Inc. and Americas Future Series have entered into a multiple-year agreement for 2016 and beyond.<br></p><p>In addition, Transformance opened an internal veteran service organization (VSO) resource center by welcoming two other VSOs to their nonprofit headquarters in Dallas. Joining Americas Future Series is the Veterans Coalition of North Central Texas (VCNCT) and Grace After Fire, each of whom will have their own presence at Transformances headquarters to expand their specific veteran outreach efforts. The aim of the VCNCT is to assist veterans and their families efforts to reintegrate back into society through opportunities related to education, employment, financial literacy, housing and mental health services. Grace After Fire is dedicated to empowering female veterans self-knowledge and self-renewal by connecting them with key resources to transition back into family life, workplace and the pursuit of happiness.<br></p><p>Unfortunately for our U.S. military veterans, statistics show troubling patterns in the lack of financial literacy. According to the 2013 FINRA Investor Education Foundations National Financial Capability Study, 42 percent have no rainy day fund, 18 percent have no retirement account, 35 percent utilize nonbank borrowing and 55 percent got three or fewer answers correct on a simple financial literacy survey.<br></p><p>We are pleased to open our facilities to all three of these honorable institutions, said Ken Goodgames, president and CEO of Transformance. The co-location of these veteran-serving organizations will serve to dramatically increase our outreach to vulnerable military and veteran families in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area, many of whom often need assistance with opportunities related to financial literacy and economic empowerment.<br></p><p>To find out how your organization or nonprofit can team up with Transformance and become a part of the financial literacy solution, call (800) 249-2227 or visit <a href="http://www.transformanceusa.org">www.transformanceusa.org</a>.<br></p><p>###<br></p><p><b>About Transformance, Inc.</b><br></p><p>In 2015, the agency will have delivered more than 125,000 consumer interactions through financial counseling, outreach, and education. &nbsp;In 2016, the agency expects to serve up to 1 million low and moderate income families with transformative financial learning solutions accessible on-line and through a new mobile app.</p><p>Since its founding in 1974 as Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Greater Dallas, the agency has empowered clients to overcome adversity and attain their financial goals. &nbsp;Services include credit/budget counseling; financial education; housing counseling; individual debt management and bankruptcy counseling.

<p>Boxer briefs have been a mens fashion icon since the 2007 Georgio Armani advertising campaign featuring David Becks Beckham which successfully skyrocketed mens designer underwear to tremendously popular new heights. Beyond the Beckham name there is a revolutionary new concept in undergarments for the precious male appendage and its accomplices. Introducing Spartan Boxer Briefs, the impressive new concept that combines not only impeccably stylish design but also astonishing modern technology to protect the wearer from harmful radiation emitted by cell-phones. Spartan founders have recently launched their Indiegogo Crowdfunding Campaign to raise the funds necessary to spread mens health and fertility awareness and to bring their incredible product to the public market.

SPARTAN Boxer Briefs point of difference and truly unique feature is the protective design technology.&nbsp;</li> <br> <li>The carefully designed fabric blocks more than 99% of harmful cell phone and wi-fi radiation by drastically reducing the negative effects that these emissions can cause.&nbsp;</li> </ul><br> <p>The alarming statistics surrounding mens fertility have prompted SPARTAN founders to investigate methods of protecting their vital manhood. Studies show that cellular radiation and wi-fi emissions are reducing sperm count by up to half as well as sperm motility and viability by up to a third. Additionally over half of the remaining sperm experience abnormal DNA structure and morphology. There is also increasing evidence that wireless device radiation has toxic genetic effects on nearby cells, which could potentially increase the risk of testicular cancer.</p> <p>Confronting this frightening reality, CEO and co-founder Arthur Menard is passionate and determined to bring Spartan Boxer Briefs to the public market. It is common for cell phones to be placed in clothing hip pockets when not in use and rather than try to change the habits of modern society, Spartan have simply put protective measures in place utilising an everyday essential clothing item.&nbsp;</p> <p>Arthur and his business partner Pierre-Louis boast impressive scholarly backgrounds in engineering and business and through their collaboration the SPARTAN Boxer Brief mission began. Arthur states Even knowing the adverse effect cellphone radiation has we kept carrying our cellphone in our hip pocketit is the most convenient place to keep them We wanted to be safe but we didnt want to have to change any of our habits  Thats why we created the SPARTAN Boxer Brief.</p> <p>Discover the Spartan Boxer Briefs today by following the below link to their Indiegogo campaign:&nbsp;<a href="http://igg.me/at/spartanboxers" title="Link: http://igg.me/at/spartanboxers">http://igg.me/at/spartanboxers</a>- END -</p> <p><br></p><p><br> <b>Media Contact Name:</b> Arthur Menard - <br> <b>Title/Position:</b> CEO<br> <b>Contact Phone:</b> +33 631 852 355<br> <b>Contact E-mail Address:</b> <a href="mailto:arthur@spartanboxers.co">arthur@spartanboxers.co</a><br> <b>Contact Address:</b> 13 rue René Bazin, 75016 Paris, FRANCE</p>

Black Friday has become synonymous in our minds with great deals. Often, the deals are impressive as businesses compete for shoppers' attention and dollars. But theres a dirty little Black Friday secret.<br><br>Just because you're buying on Black Friday doesn't mean you're getting the biggest savings. You might do better buying before or after, depending on the product. But how do you know?<br><br>Every year, software giant Adobe uses its Adobe Marketing Cloud to crunch numbers and make predictions about the upcoming season. Adobe says that it's been accurate within about 2% every year so far. This year, it examined 55 million products from 4,500 retailers stretching back to 2008 and released an incredibly detailed report. So, what does it tell us?<br><br>According to Adobe, the Monday before Thanksgiving is generally the cheapest day for buying electronics, with an average discount of 18% across 17% of items. You can find bigger single-item discounts on products Thanksgiving Day and after, but you'll also see a lot more "out-of-stock" notices if you wait.<br><br>Be aware that around 76% of shoppers buy the same 1% of product makes and models, which are mostly electronics. So if you don't buy early, you might not get that popular item you had your eye on.<br><br>This year for electronics, Adobe says Apple gadgets should lead the sales in wearables (Apple Watch), online video streaming (Apple TV) and tablets (iPad). Want to know how these Apple products stack up to their competitors? Check out my handy product comparison charts.<br><img alt="" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/robin8-production/robin8-production/6e13f7d3-d323-414d-bf28-68b949a63fac/ScreenShot20151030at20430PM.png" title="Image https3amazonawscomrobin8-productionrobin8-production6e13f7d3-d323-414d-bf28-68b949a63facScreenShot20151030at20430PMpng"><br>For video game consoles, the PlayStation 4 is going to be hot and Minecraft and Halo 5 are going to compete for the top video game.<br><br>If you're looking at 4K TVs, Adobe predicts most consumers will go for Sony over LG and Samsung. So, pay attention to the non-Sony brands for bigger discounts as retailers try to shift supply.<br><br>Thanksgiving weekend is a great time to check off some items from your family's Christmas wish lists. However, you might want to consider starting the weekend before Thanksgiving. While Cyber Monday traditionally has the cheapest toy prices, you'll get three times the out-of-stock notices. If you wait until the week before Christmas, that will double.<br><br>According to Adobe, the hottest toys this year are going to be: the remote control BB-8 droid from Star Wars: The Force Awakens,&nbsp;Barbie, American Girl dolls, Lego, Hot Wheels, the remote controlled R2-D2 toy, Razor scooters, and toys based on Disney's Frozen.&nbsp;If your child has their heart set on any of these, buying early would be wise.<br><br>Thinking of getting your significant other something sparkly for Christmas? Thanksgiving Day is the best day to buy jewelry. You should see discounts up to 25% across 20% of available items. You also shouldn't encounter many out-of-stock notices for the entire Thanksgiving weekend. Note that if you wait until December, you won't find better deals, and there will be a lot more items out of stock. So don't wait.<br><br>Clothing and other apparel items are one area where Black Friday and the surrounding shopping days don't matter as much. Thanksgiving Day will have the best savings in November with discounts of up to 27%. However, prices traditionally drop even more in December, with December 23 being the lowest. &nbsp;However, the out-of-stock risk on many products does go up as time passes.<br><br>Bonus: Some other interesting shopping facts for Black Friday<br><br>According to Adobe, deals generally start the Monday before Thanksgiving, so if you want to get a jump on shopping, go right ahead. Contrary to what you might think, Thanksgiving Day has the best deals, with Black Friday coming next, and prices increasing through Cyber Monday.<br><br>Still, Adobe expects U.S. consumers to spend $3 billion on Cyber Monday, with Black Friday coming in just behind at $2.7 billion. Thanksgiving Day shopping is also growing quickly with an expected $1.6 billion in sales, which is up 18% over last year. So, despite the growing number of retailers announcing that they're closed Thanksgiving, people will still be buying where they can, and many of them will do it online.<br><br>In fact, at least 51% of the shopping on Thanksgiving weekend will be done on mobile gadgets, which is the first time mobile shopping has crossed the 50% mark. However, Adobe finds that consumers think online shopping via mobile phone is also the most stressful way to shop thanks to the smaller screen and problems adding payment information. So, you might consider taking a tablet to your family gathering if you're planning to shop.<br><br>Also, if you do shop online, know that your best chance of finding deals is still through in-store displays. If you're looking for online deals, social media is the best place to find them, followed by promotional emails from the companies you like to shop at. Even if you're not signed up for a store's emails, you can look up promo codes for over 150,000 stores at various sites online.<br><br>On the Kim Komando Show, the nation's largest weekend radio talk show, Kim takes calls and dispenses advice on today's digital lifestyle, from smartphones and tablets to online privacy and data hacks.

<div>SPECIAL BULLETIN: CHRONIC ORTHOPEDIC/NEUROLOGICAL CONDITIONS AND THE GOLDEN YEARS &nbsp;<br><br>Many people find it exhilarating to close up the main house and go to to a warmer climate for winter each year. After years of planning &amp; preparation, they enjoying trading these cold, bitter months with restricted activity, for sunny, warm days full of outdoor activity. But few expect a CHRONIC PAIN CONDITION to come into their lives &amp; threaten this rousing scenario.</div><div><br></div><div>These statements may have applied in the past, but for many individuals who kept searching until they found an answer, they are no longer the case. Due to ongoing new developments in medicine and technology, these types of statements are not necessarily true in today's world:<br><br></div><div>&nbsp;#1 "The doctors have done all they can do. Patients just have to learn to live with it." (Not if the cause is uncovered &amp; minimized or eliminated.)<br>#2: "Because of aging, a body no longer has the ability to heal." (Modern scientific researchers say that the human body was remarkably designed to live 110-120 years, if taken care of properly.) <br>&nbsp;#3: "Medications &amp;/or injections correct the condition." &nbsp;(At best, they only manage or cover-up the symptoms, while the condition continues to degenerate or worsen.)<br>&nbsp;#4: "Only surgery will correct the problem &amp; so the doctor says to wait until it's unbearable." (It has been well documented that the success rates for surgery are not impressive &amp; often leave patients with disability, ranging from an automatic 5%/surgery, to as much as 50%.)<br><br>&nbsp;The main problem is, until now there has been no effective approach, to help doctors understand the underlying cause(s) of a patients' symptoms &amp; then, how to effectively reduce/eliminate them in situations like:<br>- orthopedic conditions such as : chronic neck &amp; back pain, arthritis, disc bulge, disc herniation, spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, failed back &amp; neck syndrome, <br>- neurological conditions such as: peripheral neuropathy (with abnormal nerve sensation in the extremities), radiating nerve pain (i.e. sciatica, neck/shoulder/arm pain, intercostal pain &amp; neck/cranial pain), as well as balance disorders, dizziness, headaches &amp; muscle weakness.<br><br>&nbsp;As a result, most doctors, (who are trained to treat ACUTE DISEASE CONDITIONS, with drugs &amp; surgery) have no other option but to treat these CHRONIC CONDITIONS same. &nbsp;These types of conditions are oftentimes better categorized as FUNCTIONAL CONDITIONS - conditions in which some body function has developed a imbalance &amp; complications, which develop into symptoms. &nbsp;If the CAUSE or CORE ISSUE is uncovered &amp; properly addressed, then the NORMAL FUNCTION is restored &amp; the symptoms are reduced or eliminated.<br><br>"The Gossett Factor" is a unique FUNCTIONAL APPROACH to examination &amp; treatment, based on Dr. T.K. Gossett's extensive post-graduate study in Orthopedics/Neurology/Functional Medicine, in addition to over 35 years of clinical practice experience, successfully treating CHRONIC-SEVERE CONDITIONS, which had not responded to traditional forms of treatment. <br><br>&nbsp;Here is a list of several common medications patients often turn to when they have a chronic orthopedic or neurological condition:<br><br>&nbsp;- OTC drugs - Aspirin, Tylenol, Advil, etc., or prescription drugs like:<br>&nbsp;-Codeine: for mild to moderately severe pain. <br>&nbsp;-Hydrocodone (Vicodin, Norco): for moderate to severe pain. Hydrocodone is the narcotic part of the drug; the non-narcotic part is acetaminophen. <br>&nbsp;-Hydromorphone (Dilaudid): for moderate to serve pain. Its delivered by injection and is available in extended-release form, for around-the-clock treatment. <br>&nbsp;-Meperidine (Demerol): for moderate to severe pain. <br>&nbsp;-Morphine (MS Contin): for moderate to severe pain. It acts on the central nervous system to relieve pain. Its available as extended-release capsules or tablets if you need it for a short time. <br>&nbsp;-Oxycodone (Oxycontin, Percocet, Percodan): for moderate to severe pain. Its prescribed for people needing pain medication around the clock for a long time.<br>&nbsp;-Lyrica/Gabapentin/Pregabalin/Carbamazepine: for the pain of peripheral neuropathy.<br><br>&nbsp;NOTE: Unfortunately, these drugs merely attempt to cover up, rather than treat the cause of patients' symptoms, so they have limited success &amp; often cause the patient to have a variety of harmful side effects - worse yet, the underlying condition continues to degenerate, without the patients' knowledge!<br><br>&nbsp;BASED ON NEW RESEARCH &amp; NEW TECHNOLOGY, THERE IS A BETTER WAY!!!<br><br>&nbsp;As stated above, Dr. T.K. Gossett is creator of "The Gossett Factor".<br><br>&nbsp;"THE GOSSETT FACTOR is a unique approach, based on a thorough FUNCTIONAL Examination &amp; a Specific Treatment Plan developed for each patient, available only at Gossett Clinic, for CHRONIC-SEVERE CONDITIONS of many types. It has, at its central focus, NEWLY DEVELOPED TREATMENT MODALITIES, which STIMULATE THE HEALING PROCESS (of nerves/muscles/joints/ligaments/organs/soft tissues), AT THE CELLULAR LEVEL, rather than merely treating the symptoms.<br><br>&nbsp;One example is:<br><br>1) The "NERVE SMART", which increases circulation to &amp; re-activates the nerve tissue AT A CELLULAR LEVEL. It is our NEW $25,000.00 Electrical Stimulation Unit. It is one of the most expensive electrical stimulation units on the market today and worth every penny, because it gets RESULTS.<br><br>&nbsp;This modality is effective in:<br>- reducing most types of acute or chronic pain syndromes listed above, <br>- reducing local inflammation/edema, as well as <br>- stimulating release of Endorphins (our body's own natural Morphine).<br>- reducing muscle spasms, &amp; provides <br>- rehabilitative treatment for weak or atrophied muscles.<br>&nbsp;- It is also effective in helping patients with Peripheral Neuropathy symptoms. <br><br>This Electrical Stimulation stimulates healing by ACTIVATING &amp; REHABILITATING the PERIPHERAL NERVES, NERVE ENDINGS &amp; MUSCLES, resulting in IMPROVED FUNCTION (reducing pain, sensitivity, numbness, tingling &amp; electric shock sensations of the nerves &amp; muscle spasm/weakness). This therapeutic procedure is much like watering a plant, stimulating new blood vessel growth around the peripheral nerves &amp; nerve endings, (like the invigorating growth of a plants root system), restoring the nervous system with increased concentrations of oxygen &amp; nutrients, resulting in nerve &amp; muscle tissue healing &amp; improved function.<br><br>&nbsp;Depending on the results of each patients initial examination, the need for these &amp; other GOSSETT FACTOR (new &amp; unique treatment modalities listed below), may be used individually or in combination with the NERVE SMART:<br><br>&nbsp;2) FAR INFRARED HEAT increases circulation &amp; softens non-elastic scar tissue, which has been deposited in the involved nerves, muscles, joints &amp; ligaments, IMPROVING THEIR FUNCTION. <br><br>&nbsp;3) NON-SURGICAL SPINAL DECOMPRESSION (an advanced, $65,000 electronic dynamic type of traction), is effective in: <br>&nbsp;-reducing pressure on the spinal cord or spinal nerve roots, caused by spinal joint compression/degeneration/disc bulge/herniation/ stenosis/ spondylolisthesis, with long-term muscle spasm/tension, <br>&nbsp;-&amp; secondarily replacing the weakened &amp; scared ligament/joint tissue, with deposition of Type IV Collagen, which is actually stronger &amp; more elastic than the original tissue.<br>&nbsp;-This therapy actually DECOMPRESSES &amp; STABILIZES THESE DISCS/JOINTS, IMPROVING THEIR FUNCTION (for shock absorption &amp; flexibility) &amp; DOES SO CONSISTENTLY, FOR THE LONG-TERM, <br><br>&nbsp;4) LASER THERAPY (a non-burning laser) further softens scar tissue &amp; &nbsp;stimulates production of:<br>&nbsp;-ELASTIN TISSUE in the Joints, Ligaments &amp; Muscles, as well as, <br>&nbsp;-NEW FORMATION OF SURROUNDING blood vessels (form maximum circulation to these regions) &amp; <br>&nbsp;-HEALING OF NERVE FIBERS &amp; protective layers around the nerve tissue,<br>&nbsp;TO IMPROVE FUNCTION OF STRENGTH, FLEXIBILITY, CIRCULATION &amp; NERVE SENSATION.<br><br>5) FLEXIBLITY &amp; STRENGTHENING EXERCISES increase the patients overall flexibility &amp; strength in the HUNDREDS OF SPINAL MUSCLES, IMPROVING THEIR FUNCTION,<br><br>&nbsp;6) BALANCE &amp; COORDINATION EXERCISES establish, OR re-establish ideal posture, balance, coordination &amp; proprioception (or sense of where a patients body parts are in space) to prevent weakness or dropping things with the hands or STUMBLING, TRIPPING &amp; FALLING with the feet, which lead to the need for the above listed medical interventions. &nbsp;<br><br>THESE COMPLICATIONS (falls), ARE THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF DISABILITY &amp; PREMATURE DEMISE OF THOSE OVER 60 YEARS OF AGE.<br><br>&nbsp;NOTE: The amount of treatment needed to allow these tissues to recover, varies from person to person and can only be determined after a detailed evaluation. The good news is, as long as the joints &amp; nerves have not sustained at least 85% damage, there is hope!<br><br>&nbsp;What makes Dr. Gossett unique? <br><br>&nbsp;1st, beyond his basic physician training, he has taken 3 years of post-graduate training in Orthopedics, <br>&nbsp;2nd he has taken over 125 additional hours of post-graduate training in Functional Neurology, <br>&nbsp;3rd he has taken over 150 hours of additional training in Functional Medicine,<br>&nbsp;4th he has at his disposal &amp; utilizes the above CUTTING-EDGE TREATMENT PROCEDURES. <br><br>&nbsp;Out of the many Physicians across the USA, Dr. Gossetts extensive post-graduate study &amp; over 35 years of successful practice experience with these types of patients, make him uniquely qualified to EFFECTIVELY ASSESS &amp; ADDRESS these types of conditions, and even more impressively, achieve successful results without the use of drugs or surgery.<br><br>&nbsp;"HELPING PEOPLE GET THEIR LIVES BACK" to enjoy the people &amp; activities they love, is WHAT drives Dr. Gossett to continue to search out &amp; develop new treatment programs for patients with chronic conditions which are resistant to traditional care. <br><br>What is the WHY, in refusing to accept these symptoms, this condition &amp; it's restrictions? Is it TRAVEL to visit family, travel to other parts of this country or even to another continent, to explore &amp; enjoy? Maybe it's STAYING ACTIVE with favorite activities, sports, hobbies or pastimes. Whatever it is, EVERYONE DESERVES THE LIFE THEY HOPED &amp; PLANNED FOR. Although everyone's situation &amp; condition is unique - MOST CAN &nbsp;experience a TRANSFORMATION, like many of Dr. Gossett's previous patients.<br><br>&nbsp;In order to extend help those who are suffering from this condition, Dr. Gossett is offering to perform a Condition Severity Examination, to determine the extent of an individual's condition for a short time, for only $97.00 (a $550.00 value), limited to SIX (6) people. This Condition Severity Examination consists of a comprehensive review of a patient's overall medical history &amp; previous testing, diagnosis &amp; treatment recommendations/results, as well as completion of a preliminary postural, orthopedic, neurologic evaluation (including reflexes, sensory, balance, coordination &amp; proprioception).<br><br>&nbsp;It may also include some additional Peripheral Vascular Testing &amp; a Toronto Scoring System evaluation, for those with neuropathy.<br><br>&nbsp;Dr. Gossett is making available, a complimentary, condition-screening-call, with a staff member, to qualify appropriate individuals for an actual consultation/examination appointment with him. This will involve the Condition Severity Examination noted above. The staff will be available to field these inquiries now through November 30th, 2015. &nbsp;If the phone goes to voicemail, the staff is probably talking with other individuals about their health concerns. &nbsp;So, simply leave a clear message with the name &amp; phone number, then state that the call is to take advantage of the Facebook Special.  The staff will follow-up with a return call ASAP.<br><br>So, call (217) 351-8040 now, to see about the possibility of making an appointment with Dr. Gossett, to determine how much nerve/muscle/joint/soft tissue/organ damage has been sustained &amp; whether the "Gossett Factor", could be of help.<br><br>NOTE: Many patients fly-in from around the country, in fact from around the world, and have experienced significant improvement in their condition in as little as a week or two, by participating in our INTENSIVES. This involves one-on-one treatment time with Dr. Gossett, as their private physician. Because of the individual time with Dr. Gossett, we must limit this opportunity to 6 patients per month.<br><br>Again, the phone number is (217) 351-8040. Tell our staff member the call is to take advantage of the Golden Years Special.<br><br>&nbsp;Call first, see if the condition qualifies and get scheduled, then visit the clinic website at gossettclinic.com to help you learn more before your meeting with Dr. Gossett.<br><br>Dont worry, if travel is not possible; we have special programs for that situation as well . . . So, contact us &amp; reach out for the help that could enable further enjoyment of "Those Golden Years". &nbsp;<br></div>

WASHINGTON  At least 13&nbsp;governors say they will not accept Syrian refugees&nbsp;in their states in response to Friday's attacks in Paris.<br><br>The Republican governors  in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Massachusetts,&nbsp;North Carolina, Ohio,&nbsp;Texas and Wisconsin  are concerned that resettlement could open the doors to terrorists.<br><br>"There may be those who will try to take advantage of the generosity of our country and the ability to move freely within our borders through this federal resettlement program, and we must ensure we are doing all we can to safeguard the security of Americans," Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said.<br><br>In Louisiana, Gov. Bobby Jindal tweeted,&nbsp;"I just signed an Executive Order instructing state agencies to take all available steps to stop the relocation of Syrian refugees to LA."<br><br>At least 132 people were killed and hundreds&nbsp;injured in a series of attacks that took place around Paris on Friday evening. Several of the attackers have been identified as French citizens. According to French prosecutors, a bomber who targeted the national stadium was found with a Syrian passport.<br><br>The passport's discovery&nbsp;raised&nbsp;concerns that Islamic State militants&nbsp;may be&nbsp;crossing into Turkey before moving to&nbsp;Western Europe alongside the hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants who have entered Europe this year, many of them fleeing the civil war in Syria.<br><br>In Michigan, Republican Gov. Rick Snyder said he is suspending his efforts encouraging resettlement of Syrian refugees in his state. But he he did not&nbsp;make any blanket statement on Monday that refugees would not be allowed into Michigan.<br><br>"Michigan is a welcoming state and we are proud of our rich history of immigration," Snyder said in the statement. "But our first priority is protecting the safety of our residents."<br><br>Comments that Snyder had made Sunday were widely viewed as an indication he would not allow Syrian refugees into the state.<br><br>About 20 Syrian refugees&nbsp;already in the pipeline for resettlement in the U.S.&nbsp;either recently arrived in Michigan or are expected to arrive soon, and Snyder said Monday he is not asking that they be stopped or vetted  leaders and refugee advocates argued&nbsp;the Department of Homeland Security already does extensive security checks before allowing any refugees into the U.S.<br><br>"The United States should be a safe haven," said Dr. Yahya Basha, a Syrian-American advocate from West Bloomfield, Mich.,&nbsp;who has family members who&nbsp;are refugees. He was at the White House recently to discuss the Syrian refugee crisis with U.S. officials:&nbsp;"We should welcome them."<br><br>Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson issued&nbsp;a statement saying the plan to resettle Syrian refugees in the United States is "is not the right strategy."<br><br>Despite such reactions, President&nbsp;Obama is continuing with plans to accept refugees from Syria. Responding to calls to admit&nbsp;Christians but not Muslims into the country, he said, "Thats shameful. Thats not American, its not who we are."<br><br>"We dont have religious tests to our compassion," he said, speaking from the G20 summit in Antalya, Turkey.<br><br>But Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a letter to the president that,&nbsp;"Neither you nor any federal official can guarantee that Syrian refugees will not be part of any terroristic activity.&nbsp;As such, opening our door to them irresponsibly exposes our fellow Americans to unacceptable peril."<br><br>One refugee advocacy organization said the governors are setting themselves up for a discrimination lawsuit.<br><br>You cant restrict certain nationalities coming to your state, said Jen Smyers, director of policy and advocacy with the Immigration and Refugee Program at Church World Service.<br><br>Democratic Gov. Peter Shumlin of Vermont&nbsp;said Monday that governors who turn away Syrian refugees are stomping on American values.<br><br>Shumlin said he believes seven or eight refugees from Syria are being considered for placement through the&nbsp;Refugee Resettlement Program in Vermont, and he believes the state can take more.<br><br>Its the spirit of all Vermonters to ensure that when you have folks who are drowning, who are dying in pursuit of freedom, that Vermont does its part, Shumlin said.<br><br>Indiana&nbsp;Gov. Mike Pence issued a statement saying his state "has a long tradition of opening our arms and homes to refugees from around the world but, as governor, my first responsibility is to ensure the safety and security of all Hoosiers.. Unless and until the state of Indiana receives assurances that proper security measures are in place, this policy will remain in full force and effect.<br><br>Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley&nbsp;acknowledged Sunday there are no plans to settle refugees in his state, or credible terror threats directed at Alabama. But he issued a statement saying he would "not place Alabamians at even the slightest possible risk of an attack on our people."<br><br>Please continue to join me in praying for those who have suffered loss and those who will never allow freedom to fade at the hands of the terrorists, Bentley said.<br><br>According to the U.S. Census, 3.5% of Alabamas population in 2014 was born in a foreign country. The national average was 12.9%.<br><br>Bentley in 2011 signed a sweeping bill that attempted to criminalize undocumented immigrants living in the state. Most elements of the law have been struck down by the federal courts.<br><br>Bentley's statement said neighboring states had accepted Syrian refugees; Louisiana has accepted 14; Syrian refugees also have&nbsp;settled in Atlanta, Memphis and&nbsp;Nashville.<br><br>The civil war in Syria, which has raged since 2011, has killed 250,000 people and, according to the United Nations, sent more than 4 million refugees into other countries to flee the violence in what has been called the largest humanitarian crisis since World War II.<br><br>At least one Republican governor said he doesn't have the authority to keep out&nbsp;certain refugees.<br><br>Florida Gov. Rick Scott, in a letter to congressional leaders Monday, said organizations have asked his state to support the relocation of 425 possible Syrian refugees&nbsp;and he wants Congress to deny federal funding for that process.<br><br>"More importantly ... it is our understanding that the state does not have the authority to prevent the federal government from funding the relocation of these Syrian refugees to Florida even without state support," Scott wrote.<br><br>The vast majority of the refugees have gone to Europe or neighboring countries. The United States accepted 1,854 Syrian refugees through September; more than 10 times as many have been admitted from Myanmar. The Obama administration has indicated that it plans to increase that number to 100,000 by 2017, which human rights advocates call inadequate to address the depths of the crisis. The U.S. accepted at least 130,000 South Vietnamese refugees in the months after the fall of Saigon in 1975.

<p><b><i></i></b><i>Investors Seek Refuge in Precious Metals After Stocks Hit Hard</i><b></b></p><p><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ADDISON, TX (Nov. 18, 2015)  Institutional and other high net worth investors in China, the world's largest producer and consumer of gold, turned to the metal as a safe haven this year as stocks fell, according to Dallas-based international wholesaler Dillon Gage Metals. After surging in recent years, Chinese equities suffered a sharp selloff this past summer, with the Shanghai Stock Exchange tumbling almost 40 percent in 10 weeks.</p><p>Because of China's market structure, weekly metal withdrawals from the Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) can be used to monitor the nation's demand, Terry Hanlon, president of Dillon Gage Metals, says. The SGE is a physical market, with no paper contracts, he explains. By law, all mined and imported gold in China must sell through the SGE. Gold purchases by the nation's end users, not including its central bank, pass through the SGE.</p><p>By mid-October, drawdowns in 2015 from the SGE totaled 2,062 tons, a sizable 33 percent above a year earlier.</p><p>Meanwhile, Chinese imports have been rising to supplement its mine production. In the past, gold imports typically came in through Hong Kong, but importers now bring the metal in from the UK, Switzerland and other countries. Since Shanghai opened new vaults in recent years, this gold enters the mainland through the SGE.</p><p>In July, China's central bank started reporting changes in its gold reserves after six years of keeping them quiet, Hanlon notes. The bank has been adding to reserves, and in September said its holdings stood at 1,693 tons. That makes China the fifth largest gold-holding nation.</p><p>The central bank of China has reasons for its new reporting transparency. China wants the yuan to be part of the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Special Drawing Rights (SDR) basket, Hanlon says. Officials are building gold reserves to back the yuan, hoping it will become an international currency with reserve status.</p><p>Today's SDR basket includes the dollar, the pound, the yen and the euro, which together determine the value of an SDR  an IMF-created asset to address liquidity issues between central banks.</p><p>China's economic growth, though stronger than in other leading nations, is slowing. In a surprise devaluation in August, the central bank reduced the yuan's value, sending it to a four-year low. When they did that, authorities were reacting to a string of weak economic data last summer. The numbers suggested the yuan was overvalued and affecting exports.</p><p>As of late October, China's central bank had cut interest rates six times in under a year, eyeing second-half 2015 growth that may dip to a 25-year low of less than 7 percent. This fall, officials are working on a new five-year plan, which will impact gross domestic product growth (GDP). It will have to be approved by the Chinese legislature next year. Planners have signaled a desire to move to slower, but steady, growth led by domestic demand and less dependent on exports.</p><p>As for the impact of China's stock sell-off on its residents, households there have less invested in equities than Americans do. Their wealth is mostly tied up in real estate.</p><p>China and India are the world's largest consumers of gold, and they alternate between which one leads. China's demand is on a long-term uptrend. But the nation's thirst for bullion, gold coins and jewelry waned in 2014. And its jewelry demand slipped in this year's second quarter, hurt by a slowing GDP and the stock market's slide. Demand is expected to improve this fall and winter, however, because of jewelry giving between the nation's recent Golden Week holidays in early October and Chinese New Year's in February.</p><p>In July, the London daily gold-price fix sank to a six-year low of $1,080 an ounce, but has since recovered a bit. Chinese consumers tend to buy gold on price dips.</p><p>In the last decade, Chinese gold production from mines grew at a faster pace than in other countries, making it tops in the world, followed by Australia. Chinese output, estimated at more than 462 tons in 2014, stays within its borders to meet industrial and jewelry needs.</p><p>Zijinshan Gold and Copper Mine, started up by Zijin Mining in 1993 in Fujian province, is one of the country's big gold producers. Its extraction costs are rising, however. China's open mines extract gold ore from hard rock. Mining from deposits in river beds is another source. The industry contains few large-scale gold mines and has more moderate-sized operations, including a number of smaller, artisanal and often illegal ones. Environmentalists complain about unsafe practices, including dynamite detonation and use of pollution-creating mercury.</p><p>Recognizing China's growth as a gold hub earlier this year, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) launched a physically delivered, kilogram gold futures contract, settled in Hong Kong at CME-approved locations. The CME noted that as gold demand swells in China and the Far East, the physical bullion market is moving eastward.</p><p>For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.dillongage.com">www.dillongage.com</a> or call (800) 375-4653.</p><p># # #</p><p><b>About Dillon Gage Metals</b><br> Dillon Gage Inc. of Dallas (DillonGage.com), founded in 1976, companies include:</p><p>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Dillon Gage Metals (<a href="http://www.DillonGage.com/Metals">www.DillonGage.com/Metals</a>), one of the worlds largest precious metals wholesale trading firms.

<p>Hip dysplasia is a condition that babies are prone to for a number of different reasons. Genetics play a role, and babys position in the womb can also place pressure on the hip. Some babies have more ligament laxity and, because the hip socket is soft and pliable, it is easier for babys hip to subluxate. Hip dysplasia can lead to various problems later in life, which is why its important to be aware of what can be done to prevent the problem from getting worse. Swanling founders Joanna and Jan Marco von Yurt are trying to raise awareness by providing parents with information and a <a href="http://www.swanling.com/" target="_blank">healthy solution for baby sleep</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>While hip dysplasia cannot really be prevented, as many cases are present at birth, parents can learn what to do to keep it from getting worse. Swaddling baby is a method that is encouraged to help baby sleep better, but some parents are not aware that tightly swaddling baby can lead to hip dysplasia. Its difficult for new parents to know the correct way to swaddle baby with a traditional blanket, and not all baby swaddles are recognized as hip healthy by the International Hip Dysplasia Institute (IHDI). </p><p><br></p><p>The Swanling Slumber Sleeper and Slumber Swaddle are products invented by the von Yurts that are both recognized by the IHDI. These safe sleep products do not put any strain on babys hips, all while promoting feelings of comfort, safety, and security. </p><p><br></p><p>The Slumber Sleeper&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The Slumber Sleeper is an all-in-1&nbsp;<a href="http://www.swanling.com/" target="_blank">safe sleep solution</a>.

The Slumber Swaddle uses our original Snap-in-Place system to attach securely at the waistband of the Slumber Sleeper. The Snap-in-Place system ensures that the swaddle will stay in place and helps keep baby comfortably wrapped through the night. The wonderfully soft lightweight bamboo jersey fabric is breathable helping your infant maintain a comfortable temperature. Further, our wonderful hands to heart or fetal tuck position pockets ensure children have the comfort they so need to sleep well.

Patient records often contain associated billing information and insurance data - these are the primary objects of interest.</p><p>For instance, someone could set up a company that purports to sell electric wheelchairs, and bill the government thousands of dollars for every wheelchair they ship on paper, using Medicaid/Medicare numbers obtained this way.</p><p>Prescription medicines (for which they need to know which patients were prescribed what) are another way in which health insurance fraud could be perpetrated.</p><p>Having access to credit card information compounds the problem further. Any charges are billed first and the money transferred immediately. They can be disputed only later.</p><p><b>What can I do?</b></p><p>You can protect yourself by checking your credit report regularly. The three major credit-reporting agencies - Transunion, Equifax and Experian - all offer a free credit report once a year. You could get a credit report every four months at no extra cost and dispute anything out of place. Not doing so only affects your credit score.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>                        </p><p>There are now companies that provide protection against medical identity theft. It is a good idea to read up on the terms and conditions first, understand exactly what is being offered, and then sign up if it makes sense financially. Some of the best identity theft protection plan companies in the country that protect against ID theft can all be found on <a href="https://velvetprotection.com/">VelvetProtection.com</a>.</p>
<p><b>Beijing, November 18 2015</b>  CITIC Group and Baidu, Chinas leading search engine, today announced a strategic cooperation agreement under which Baidu and CITIC Bank will jointly establish Baixin Bank, the first joint venture bank formed by an Internet company and a traditional bank in China. The strategic tie-up represents a new model for combining Internet and finance, and a major step forward for Baidu in addressing Chinas large and fast-growing financial services industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With over 640 million users searching on Baidu every month, Baidu has long served as a primary gateway for people to find the financial products and services theyre looking for, making the Baidu search engine a powerful distribution channel for financial services. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>CITIC was one of the first commercial banks established in China after the inauguration of reform, and has operations in 126 cities with close to 1,300 business outlets. CITICs assets total over 4 trillion RMB. The bank ranked 33rd in the <i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>Banker</i> magazine<i>s</i> July 2015 ranking of the worlds 1000 top banks by Tier 1 capital, and 46th by overall capital. Baixin Bank will combine the core strengths of Baidu and CITIC, and will offer a wide range of financial solutions for enterprises and for individuals. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Baidus scope extends from connecting people with information to connecting people with services. The establishment of Baixin Bank will mark a milestone for Internet finance in China, said Robin Li, chairman and CEO of Baidu. "This is the first in-depth cooperation between an Internet company and a traditional bank, representing an entirely new model of Internet + bankinga bank that truly understands both the Internet and financial services. Together, we will pioneer and build the future of Internet finance. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chang Zhenming, chairman of CITIC Bank, said, The joint establishment of this direct bank not only marks the further deepening of bilateral cooperation, but also represents a meaningful effort to integrate the traditional banking business with Internet companies. The new direct bank will leverage the strengths of both sides, creating a powerful force for finance + Internet. It will better meet the growing needs of ordinary people and small businesses for financial services, helping to create a more inclusive finance, and supporting the development of the real economy. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Baidu brings to the Baixin Bank its massive traffic resources, vast behavioral data and powerful data analytics capabilities. Coupling Baidus strengths with CITICs leading financial product design capabilities, Baixin Bank will be able to offer innovative products to meet the needs of individual customers. CITICs account systems and large network of offline outlets, meanwhile, will ensure that Baixin Banks customers receive high-quality service whether online or offline. Both parties will contribute to better risk management, combining CITIC Banks expertise in traditional risk assessment with Baidus capabilities, based on dynamic behavior-based Internet data. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pending approval by the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) of a direct banking license, the Baixin Bank will operate in strict accordance with the requirements set forth by the CBRC. The banks mission will be "to manage wealth for the people and finance for the public, to develop an inclusive approach to finance, and to service the real economy." The bank will address the major financial pain points that individuals and SMEs currently encounter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Baidu also announced that Baidu Wallet, Baidus online payment platform, has officially launched a 1% cash-back program that will have no end date: Consumers using Baidu Wallet to pay will henceforth receive an immediate 1% cash rebate on all purchases. Baidu Wallet is an important part of Baidus services ecosystem, and will help support Baixin Bank with data, users, and business development opportunities with Baidus SME customers. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As part of its commitment to more inclusive financial services, CITIC Bank also announced that beginning December 1, customers will be able to make online transfers free of charge across China. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>About Baidu</b></p><p>Baidu, Inc. is the leading Chinese language Internet search provider.

<p></p><p>  <p>International entrepreneurs Bill Rowell and Edward Armstrong, founders of Golden Portrait, are revolutionizing the way consumers preserve their photographs by replacing photo paper and other print materials with Pure 24k Swiss Refined GOLD </p>  <p>Bill and Edward merged their skills, knowledge, passion and experience together to create Golden Portraits, which are produced under the strict control and certification of a group of hand chosen, international, 2nd generation, gold setting artists. This Swiss Refined and Certified Gold is carefully crafted into fine layers of pure 24k gold settings. It is then prepared for the photographic interfusion process. </p>  <p>The specialized Interfusion Process begins with the personal digital, high resolution photo of that Special Moment chosen by the consumer. &nbsp; These personal digital photographs are uploaded to the photo editor section of the company website.&nbsp; Customers may choose between portrait, landscape or desktop frame styles.&nbsp; </p>  <p>Golden Portrait then proceeds with the delicate process of interfusing the digital photo into the previously prepared 24k gold settings. Upon the completion of the interfusing process, the elegance of the consumers new 24K Swiss Refined Golden portrait is encased with a dark wooden frame. The polished glass that overlay the newly created heirloom will most certainly bring the customers new Golden Portrait alive.</p>  <p>&nbsp;Our parents generation would print photographs then place them into photo albums rarely to be viewed, or place them inside boxes that collect dust for years to come.&nbsp; More recent generations take digital photographs and download them onto their computer hard drive or save them onto flash drives forgetting about them for even longer then our parents generations Bill &nbsp;said. </p>  <p>Edward continued on by stating that the problem is that these methods forever hideaway the individual moments in a persons life that deemed them worthy to be photographed in the first place.</p>  <p>Laverne Armstrong (U.S. National Director), seeing the vast need for Golden Portraits to be made available to the American market, as well as the Global market, established the U.S. Corporate Office Location in Union City, CA.&nbsp;  It is from here that she also launched the American debut of My Golden Portrait during the 2015 Annual Megafest event hosted by Bishop T.D. Jakes in Dallas TX this past August.</p>  <p>I feel our website sums it up well Laverne said. While modern technology has improved the quality of our most treasured photographs, the durability and lasting quality on paper and in digital format is still questionable. Where would you trust your most treasured memories to, paper, digital format or 24K gold?&nbsp; At Golden Portrait we have embodied this ancient principle of Eternalizing Your Memories by replacing photo paper and other print materials with Pure 24k Swiss Refined GOLD.</p>  <p>The price of a 24k Swiss Refined Golden Portrait start at approximately $327 for a desktop frame and range up to $527 for the largest frame size of about 19.05 in. (x) 21.92 in. Golden Portrait also provides Global Distribution for all orders and can shipped within 4 to 6 weeks after the initial order is accepted. </p>  <p>Golden Portraits mission is to provide customers and their future generations with a moment of time cherished as an heirloom, represented and preserved, in a high quality 24K Swiss Refined Golden Portrait.</p>  Visit <a href="http://MyGoldenPortrait.com">http://MyGoldenPortrait.com</a> for information on how to get your Golden Portrait today.</p><br>

French couture house Christian Dior is giving consumers creative control over how to apply its newest scent, Jadore Touche de Parfum, by comparing the application with a ritual.<br><br>Diors latest addition to the Jadore fragrance line was announced on Sept. 23 with content published to the brands online magazine, DiorMag. Content posted delves deep into the scent and marketing communications created&nbsp;to promote Jadore Touche de Parfum, allowing consumers to get a solid&nbsp;grasp on the fragrances characteristics.<br><br>Its smart because it allows Dior to control the environment and deepens the communication with its consumer, said Terry Rieser, co-founder and COO of Tag Creative. I think it strengthens its position as a fashion authority in a way that is uniquely Dior.<br><br>Ms. is not affiliated with Dior, but agreed to comment as an industry expert.<br><br>Dior was unable to comment&nbsp;directly by press deadline.<br><br>A new ritual<br><br> Using its social media accounts, Dior directed its consumers to DiorMag through posts that did not give away too much information about Jadore Touche de Parfum. Instead, Dior placed all of its content within DiorMag, a source for all brand happenings.<br><br>The first post on Sept. 23 introduced the fragrance and its brand ambassador Charlize Theron. For more than a decade the actress has been the face of the Jadore fragrance collection, making her a likely selection for the new campaign, which also ensures a sense of trust among consumers when a new scent is launched.<br><br>Charlize is the literal embodiment of the Jadore brand so I couldnt imagine any other woman being the face of that iconic bottle, Ms. Rieser said. When you create such a strong relationship with a line as she has done, its integral to maintaining brand consistency.<br><br>Ms. Theron last starred in Diors updated multichannel campaign for the original JAdore last September (see story).<br><br>Dior continued sharing details about the campaign for Jadore Touche de Parfum with a behind-the-scenes image of Ms. Theron and photographer Peter Lindbergh, who shot the campaign.<br><br>A full version of the film created for Jadore Touche de Parfum can be viewed on DiorMag as well, but as of press time, the video had not yet been shared socially beyond YouTube by Dior. In the video, Ms Theron wears a gold shimmery dress that shines as she walks down a darkened street approaching the camera.<br><br>When Ms. Theron gets closer to the camera, the angle changes to show different aspects of her body and golden gown.<br><br><br><br> Dior Jadore  The new visual  Behind the scene<br><br>Diors video content was followed by two posts that are more focused on the fragrance itself.<br><br>The first describes Jadore Touche de Parfum as a new page in [Jadores] sparkling story, as this scent is redefining how women apply fragrance, meaning that Dior is encouraging consumers to wear the perfume either on its own or with others in the collection for a layering effect.<br><br>Dior suggests layering the scent with other Jadore fragrances such as LOr, Eau de Parfum, LAbsolu and Voile de Parfum. This is achieved through blotting Jadore Touche de Parfum&nbsp;on the skin using its cap.<br><br>Diors exclusive perfumer-creator Francois Demachy created Jadore Touche de Parfum to adapt to the ritual and character of each woman to tell a story of her singularity by responding to her skin. This concept is being expressed socially through the hashtag #MakeJadoreYours.<br><br>As with much of Diors design and marketing strategy, this is linked to the brands eponymous founder, who was quoted as saying, Just like your clothing, your perfume expresses your personality. Thus you can change it, according to your mood.<br><br>On its own, Diors Jadore Touche de Parfum has notes of damask roses, sambac jasmine and Sri Lankan sandalwood. These notes are then explored further in a second film shared to DiorMag.<br><br>The video stars Ms. Theron, who also narrates, speaking&nbsp;of how only the wearer can feel a fragrance and explore [her]&nbsp;essence. Visuals show the Jadore Touche de Parfum bottle in detail as well as the elements of the fragrance such as chips of sandalwood and blossoms and petals of roses and jasmine.<br><br>Stacked scent<br><br> Recently, there has been a surge in niche fragrance brands and bespoke scents that allow consumers to match their&nbsp;moods or personalities directly to a perfume. Layering scents is also trending, but many consumers may not feel confident to do so on their own without the direction of a trusted brand.<br><br>For instance, French fashion label Givenchy is allowing consumers to create their own scent profile each time they wear Ange ou Démon Le Parfum &amp; Accord Illicite, a fragrance duo.<br><br>Consumers can either wear the fragrances together for a layered scent profile, or wear them alone. To layer, the consumer would spritz on Le Parfum before adding Accord Illicite drops to the pulse points (see story).<br><br>[At Tag Creative we] see the brands we work with and the beauty industry as a whole beginning to shift toward the trend of personalization and customization, Ms. Rieser said. These are important trends that capture the spitit of consumers today.<br><br>We are clearly seeing an array of demographics seeking brands that understand their need for a deeper level of personalization, she said. It is no longer about finding a brand that you associate with, but more identifying a brand that customizes to the consumer.<br><br>Final Take<br><br> Jen King, lead reporter on Luxury Daily, New York<br><br><br><br>Jen King is a lead reporter on Luxury Daily.

<p>At this time of year, its hard not to get into the festive spirit. We know that indulging in rich food and drink can be tempting, and the opportunity to savor seasonal treats can throw a wrench in the works for pregnant women who may be trying to stick to a clean-eating regime.</p><p><br></p><p>To beat the temptation of the holiday season, Baby2Body Founder and CEO Melinda Nicci has compiled some fantastic tips to make the most of the festivities, without compromising on a healthy lifestyle.</p><p><br></p><p>1.&nbsp;Keep a healthy diet at the forefront of your mind &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Craving rich, sugary treats is common throughout many pregnancies, as it can indicate a womans desire to provide high-caloric, high-fat foods for her baby  and help it survive and thrive in her womb. The holiday season can make these cravings more frequent, as these treats are often on display at parties and family gatherings. When a craving strikes, its best to stick to fresh fruit and vegetables or a handful of nuts and raisins to avoid a sugar high  and an inevitable crash later on. </p><p><br></p><p>These nutritious, small snacks will satisfy your sweet tooth, and keep your blood sugar levels stable, too.</p><p><br></p><p>2.&nbsp;Eat little and often</p><p><br></p><p>Big family meals with plates piled high can be incredibly tempting, but eating little and often will make your experience this holiday season a lot more pleasant. During the later stages of pregnancy, your stomachs capacity will be reduced due to your baby taking up a lot of room, so filling up will prove incredibly uncomfortable. Try eating smaller meals, and place emphasis on foods that offer slow-releasing energy, lean meat and fish, and plenty of fresh veggies.</p><p><br></p><p>3.&nbsp;Dont miss out  have a mocktail</p><p><br></p><p>The holidays make for the perfect opportunity to imbibe, but during a pregnancy, alcohol consumption should absolutely be avoided. If you want to join in with the toasts and revelry, try a mocktail  youll get all the flavor of a fruity cocktail, without the alcohol. </p><p><br></p><p>Heres the Baby2Body recipe for a delicious, light and festive margarita: </p><p><br></p><p>Ingredients:</p><p><br></p><p>- 2 cups of lemonade<br>- 1 frozen banana<br>- 2 tbsp of cashews</p><p><br></p><p>Directions:</p><p><br></p><p>- Squeeze fresh lemon juice as desired<br>- Add some fresh strawberries<br>- Top it off with ice and blend!</p><p><br></p><p>4.&nbsp;Get creative with H2O</p><p><br></p><p>We all know drinking water is essential in our day-to-day lives, and during pregnancy, its of the utmost importance. However, it can feel boring when everyone else is sipping on eggnog and mulled wine. Liven up your eight glasses a day with a delicious blend of citrus fruits and berries, or try mint and cucumber for a refreshing kick that will keep you hydrated and satisfied!</p><p><br></p><p>5.&nbsp;Make easy, delicious swaps</p><p><br></p><p>Christmas and Thanksgiving wouldnt be the same without an abundance of pumpkin pie and Christmas cake; however, they are loaded with fat and sugar. Swapping decadent desserts for lighter options will keep you feeling trim, reduce bloating and boost your confidence too. Our favorite easy swaps include making a big batch of warming stewed apples, a zesty orange polenta cake, or a seriously easy ice cream alternative with just one ingredient: banana. Pop a banana in the freezer overnight, remove peel, blend and eat immediately  youll have a delicious whipped banana pudding that tastes just like your favorite gelato!</p><p><br></p><p>6.&nbsp;Exercise, exercise, exercise!</p><p><br></p><p>The weather shouldnt deter you from working out, although the chill of winter can be off-putting. Try and exercise for 20 minutes every day; a brisk walk will get your heart pumping, release endorphins, offer some much needed stress-release, burn calories, and enable you to sleep soundly. Head off for a stroll with a friend or your partner if you need some motivation.</p><p><br></p><p>7.&nbsp;Take time to relax and recharge&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The holidays can be a stressful period, what with the constant meals and parties, decorations, meal prep and more. We encourage you to practice your meditation techniques, and find some practices that help you unwind and relax. Our preferred methods include closing your eyes for two minutes in a comfortable position and visualizing a beautiful and tranquil space, focusing on deep breathing, and listing the people and things you have to be thankful for. Tis the season to be grateful!</p><p><br></p><p>Additionally, theres no shame in asking for help  be it from a relative, partner, friend or neighbor, a friendly face can halve a problem with a simple chat over a cup of (caffeine-free) tea. </p><p><br></p><p>About Melinda Nicci&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Melinda Nicci is the Founder and CEO of Baby2Body, and a sport psychologist, trainer and author with 20+ years experience in pre and post-natal fitness, health and wellbeing.

<p><a href="http://legacyer.com/">Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care</a>, one of the nations first hybrid health care models offering both urgent care and emergency room treatment options under one roof, is celebrating its two year birthday in Allen, Texas (1310 W. Exchange Pkwy.). Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care is headquartered in Plano, Texas with seven health care centers in Allen, Coppell, Frisco (2), Keller, McKinney and North Richland Hills. </p><p>Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care - Allen is a Texas state-licensed 7,632 SF Freestanding emergency &amp; urgent care facility in Allen, Texas. Its award-winning building was designed by <a href="http://www.5gstudio.com/">5G Studio</a> and was 5G Studios second facility. The design concept built upon the success of their first facility in Frisco, Texas where the distinctive architecture and interior design of the facility continue to bring as much brand recognition as the exceptional medical service. The building combines two traditionally separate programs, the emergency room and the urgent care, under one roof. The progressive architectural design integrated the elements of sustainable and evidence-based design to offer a soothing environment for patients seeking care under distressed conditions. The project held its ground breaking ceremony on March 21, 2013. </p><p>Co-Founder and Chief Medical Officer Jay Woody, MD states, "Since we started Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care in 2008 we wanted to present a completely different health care experience for our patients and that included the aesthetic of the facility. &nbsp;When we expanded to Allen we were presented an opportunity to design our perfect scenario from scratch thanks to the support from the city. &nbsp;We are so proud of our results and the thousands of patients that visit every month unanimously agree they love the clean, non-healthcare feel of the facility" &nbsp;</p><p>At Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care, patients only pay for the care they need. No more making financial decisions when a family member needs to feel better. Legacy ER &amp; Urgent care is always on whether a condition will get billed as an urgent care visit (more than 70 percent fall into this category) or an emergency.<b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>Unlike most free-standing ERs today, Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care wont bill you emergency room prices unless you actually need emergency care. If you go in during urgent care hours for a sore throat or some other non-emergency situation, youre charged urgent care prices, not emergency room prices, which can save you hundreds of dollars per visit, explains Keith Miller, president of Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care.</p><p>Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care has the ability to treat and care for almost any emergency and all urgent care needs.</p><table>  <tbody><tr>   <td>   <p>Chest pains</p>   </td>   <td>   <p>Abdominal pains</p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td>   <p>Lacerations, wounds or bleeding</p>   </td>   <td>   <p>Sore throats, itchy eyes, fever</p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td>   <p>Fractures, sprains, bruising</p>   </td>   <td>   <p>Pediatrics</p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td>   <p>Stroke symptoms or seizures</p>   </td>   <td>   <p>Insect bites, stings, allergic reactions</p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td>   <p>Allergies</p>   </td>   <td>   <p>Burns, major and minor</p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td>   <p>Pink eye</p>   </td>   <td>   <p>Pneumonia</p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td>   <p>Rash</p>   </td>   <td>   <p>Back Pain</p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td>   <p>Headaches or head injuries</p>   </td>   <td>   <p>Vomiting</p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td>   <p>Accidental Poisoning</p>   </td>   <td>   <p>Appendicitis</p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td>   <p>Asthma &amp; Breathing problems</p>   </td>   <td>   <p>Blood clots</p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td>   <p>Chemical exposure</p>   </td>   <td>   <p>Dehydration</p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td>   <p>Dizziness</p>   </td>   <td>   <p>Eye injuries</p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td class="wysiwyg-tmp-selected-cell">   <p>Foreign body removal</p>   </td>   <td>   <p>&nbsp;</p>   </td>  </tr> </tbody></table><p>Urgent care hours are from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily, and ER services are accessible 24/7, 365 days a year.

<p><b>Student run company, ChugaChaga, set to launch this January.</b></p><p><b>New York City, New York- </b>Student entrepreneurs from the University of Albany are set to launch the next generation organic health beverage at the start of 2016. These students started strong by placing in the NYS business plan competition in April. This summer they developed in a locally based accelerator, ultimately leading to their acceptance into the world-class Food-X accelerator in NYC. While in Food-X, these students rapidly developed their business and beverage with the help of titans in the food industry. </p><p>ChugaChagas revolutionary beverage Tree Tea is the worlds first wild crafted, organic, and Non-GMO certified chaga beverage. For those who are unaware, chaga is a superfood local to the northern United States renowned for its health enhancing properties and great taste. Chaga has one of the highest concentrations of antioxidants of any food ever tested and dense sugars that help to maintain healthy immune &amp; digestive systems. ChugaChaga takes care of a major pain point for consumers looking to try chaga, getting it. Chaga grows in cold mountainous terrain, with its primary harvest season in harsh winter months. So instead of going gangrene in the Adirondacks, ChugaChaga takes care for everything from Tree to Tea with their network of harvesters who sustainably handpick wild chaga. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Founder and CEO Luke Evans was a chef in the Catskills when he first learned about the power of chaga. While in his junior year of High School, Luke embarked on a hike with his mentor in search of the elusive chaga mushroom. From the moment he set his eyes on chaga, Luke knew that his life would never be the same again. Watching my brother battle cancer throughout my childhood profoundly impacted my life. The mantra let thy medicine be thy food and food be thy medicine was ingrained in my career as a chef and ultimately inspired me to start ChugaChaga. said Luke Evans. As he entered college and his ideas fermented, Luke recruited two of his close friends to make dreams a reality and the trio has been unstoppable ever since. </p><p>      </p><p>On December 3rd the team presented at Food-Xs demo day in front of hundreds of the food industrys top innovators; only to ship off to California for the BevNet Live New Beverage Showdowns Semifinals on December 7th &amp; 8th. Through their drive and ambition the ChugaChaga team is certain to accomplish their mission of spreading the power of chaga by adapting it to the modern lifestyle. If you want to join the Fungi Tribe, on their quest of making ChugaChaga the premier national brand of chaga beverages, be sure to check out their website and Kickstarter campaign, which is running from Jan. 19th through Feb. 18th &nbsp;Tree tea will be available in multiple locations throughout NYC and online!</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Contact:</b></p><p>Marc Iskandar, Chief Marketing Officer</p><p>813 Washington Ave, Albany, NY, 12206</p><p>(516) 647-6802</p><p>                    </p><p>marciskandar@chugachaga.com  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>HORSHAM, PA., November 23, 2015 &nbsp; --&nbsp;  Traffic safety experts consider the Thanksgiving holiday weekend to be among the most dangerous driving times of the year.&nbsp; Nearly 1,200 people were killed in traffic crashes throughout the nation over a recent Thanksgiving weekend, according to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration statistics.</p><p>What makes it such a risky time on the road?&nbsp; Thanksgiving is one of the busiest travel times with people driving to family gatherings and students returning home from college.&nbsp; Wine is often consumed with the big meal, and beer often is the beverage of choice as we watch football games on TV.&nbsp; Add to that the fact that a big turkey dinner can cause drivers to feel drowsy.</p><p>"A convergence of factors at Thanksgiving time make impaired and drowsy driving real dangers," said Randy Wright, President of Cottman Transmission and Total Auto Care, a nationwide transmission and auto repair brand that services almost any make or model vehicle, foreign or domestic.&nbsp; "All of us at Cottman work hard to keep you and your car safe and reliable, so we urge you do your part by taking precautions on this festive holiday.&nbsp; We want both you and your car to travel safely."</p><p>Safety experts say we tend to get sleepy after a big meal, especially one that includes roasted turkey, which has enzymes that may cause drowsiness.&nbsp; Studies also show that even one or two alcoholic drinks with a meal can seriously impair driving ability.</p><p>Cottman offers some simple tips to help keep Thanksgiving safe and joyous for people who must travel by car, whether locally or over big distances.</p><p><ul><li>Be sure the driver and all passengers are      wearing seat belts.</li><li>If you plan to drive, don't drink or take      drugs.&nbsp; If you do plan to drink,      designate a sober driver before the holiday celebration begins.</li><li>Avoid driving long distances after a big      holiday meal.&nbsp; If possible, have      someone who can share driving tasks, and allow extra time for frequent      rest stops.</li><li>If you feel yourself nodding off, find a safe      place to pull over, have coffee or a caffeinated product and close your      eyes for a 20-minute nap.&nbsp;</li></ul></p><p><b>About Cottman Transmission and Total Auto Care:</b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>                                </p><p>With locations across the U.S., Cottman Transmission and Total Auto Care is a transmission and auto repair brand that services almost any make or model vehicle, foreign or domestic.

HART will hold a conference call at&nbsp;5:00 p.m. ET&nbsp;today to discuss these results.</p><p>Jim McGorry, HART CEO, commented: "We pursued these animal studies to test the design and technology enhancements we have made to our second generation technology and to prepare us for our upcoming studies with the Mayo Clinic. We are very encouraged by the results of these studies and by the significant advancements we have made across all three indications. In particular, results for the Gen2 implant in the esophagus far exceeded our expectations, particularly given the study's brief duration. Over a two-week period, all layers of the esophagus, most notably the epithelial and muscle layers, were fully regenerated, and components of esophageal nerves were present. Such nerves are fundamental to the proper contraction of the muscles that move food along the esophagus."</p><p>Mr. McGorry continued, "Based on the strong performance of our Gen2 implants in all three indications, we are well-positioned as we move forward with confirmatory longer-term large-animal studies with Mayo Clinic in December."</p><p>Research and Development Highlights:</p><ul><li>HART's Gen2 technology reflects design enhancements to improve the body's response to the implant and to better guide the repair of tissue in the healing process.</li><li>HART's recent animal studies tested all three of its Gen2 implants  esophagus, trachea, and bronchus  demonstrating resolution of the negative inflammatory response observed with the prior generation of the technology.</li><li>Clinically significant evidence of tissue and nerve regeneration was observed in the esophageal implant, positioning the esophageal implant as the current lead development priority.</li><li>HART is initiating confirmatory and longer-term large-animal studies with Mayo Clinic in December.</li><li>HART remains on track to conduct human compassionate use surgeries and to file an initial IND application with U.S. FDA in 2016.</li></ul><p><b>Research Findings<br></b>Saverio La Francesca, M.D., HART's CMO, added, "We have demonstrated a very significant improvement in the body's response to the implant in the tracheal position, and we have observed initial engraftment of the implant into the surrounding tissues.

Based on these data, we believe that our second generation implant possesses all the necessary cues to elicit full regeneration of the esophagus. Importantly, our esophageal implant addresses a very significant need as a potentially life-saving treatment for patients with esophageal cancer. Each year in the U.S. approximately 17,000 new cases of esophageal cancer are diagnosed, and more than 4,000 are addressed by surgery.

<p>DALLAS, TEXAS (November 25, 2015) A bright future is ahead for North Texas-based <a href="http://www.soulmans.com/">Soulmans Bar-B-Que</a>. Its 40-plus-year-old brand is seeing booming growth surpassing 500 percent during the last eight years. Currently with fifteen established restaurants, 11 have emerged in the last eight years under the leadership of Brett Randle, CEO of Soulmans Bar-B-Que.</p><p>With plans to continue expansion, Randle explains what makes Soulmans so successful and why this growth is possible.</p><p>                                                    As a team we are passionately committed to keeping things true and simple. &nbsp; Our future growth depends on a daily focus on what makes our restaurants successful--great food, great service and clean environment in which to enjoy it. Preserving our heritage is vital to us at Soulman's.  As a 41 year old brand, we try hard to stay away from trendiness.  We are a traditional Texas Bar-B-Que house. We do things the accepted way, the right way, and were resolved to continue that through our growth, says Randle.</p><p>This classic style of barbecue enables Soulmans to pursue continued growth with four more restaurant locations anticipated to open.</p><p>In 2008, we had four locations and weve grown to 15. We have 16, 17, 18 and 19 already on the way for 2016, adds Randle.</p><p>And this growth has nothing to do with luck. In a commodity market that relies on fluctuating meat prices, Soulmans has been able to adjust to these market changes and come out on top. When beef prices soared last year, Soulmans strategized to provide the best, affordable and tasty options for their customers.</p><p>2014 was a challenging year with regard to Cost of Goods.  Specifically, brisket prices sky-rocketed to unprecedented levels very quickly.  Considering Brisket makes up approximately 35% of Soulman's food spend, a near 100% increase in a matter of months was potentially catastrophic.  However, our team rose to the challenge. &nbsp; We introduced more efficient products, re-negotiated food deals and created new menu items that would sway our product mix away from brisket. Overall the plan was a great success, Randle says.</p><p>Compared to the national average of restaurant growth, Soulmans is a standout establishment. According to the <a href="https://www.restaurant.org/Downloads/PDFs/News-Research/research/ForecastExecSummary2015-FINAL.pdf">National Restaurant Associations 2015 Executive Summary</a>, restaurant-and-foodservice sales are projected to top $709 billion, up 3.8 percent from 2014. In comparison to similar markets, Soulmans percentage of growth shines.</p><p>Restaurantnews.com shares the 2013 <a href="http://www.restaurantnews.com/restaurant-chain-growth-report-52813/">Restaurant Chain Growth Report</a>, which compares Soulmans growth in 2013 with other restaurants with fewer than 20 units. Compared with other lunch and dinner restaurants like El Taco Tote based in El Paso, TX which has experienced a 15 percent growth, Soulmans increased their business by 22 percent in 2013.</p><p><b>About Soulmans Bar-B-Que<br> </b>For more than 40 years, Soulman's&nbsp;Bar-B-Que has satisfied the hardest to please barbecue loversTexans! Their selections of meats are cooked low and slow over hickory in a time-honored tradition: beef brisket, ham, hot links, sausage, turkey, chicken, pulled pork and, the crowd favorite, ribs. Ranch House Beans and Spicy Cream Corn are among the delicious homemade sides.</p><p>Soulmans currently owns and operates 15 North and East Texas locations in Cedar Hill, Dallas, Forney, Garland, Greenville, Hurst, Lancaster, Mesquite, Quinlan, Rockwall (2), Royse City, Terrell, Van and Allen.

They rely on this basic law of attraction, by surrounding their guests with intelligent and gorgeous women it will entice them to stay longer, spend more money and ultimately have attendees spread the word of what a memorable evening theyve had.</p><p>Truth be told, this magic formula works, but it has grown increasingly costly to pay promoters to send out mass emails and texts to pretty girls simply in the hopes they may show up. There are never any guarantees with this method. Well, now there is a way to&nbsp;guarantee commercial success of your next event&nbsp;and do away with overpaying a promoter for unpredictable results. ModelHostess.com has streamlined the screening process and made it easier than ever for party planners and club owners to secure attractive atmosphere models, staff and entertainers for their next special event.</p><h4></h4><h1><a href="http://modelhostess.com/modeltype/Atmosphere?city=1">Prescreened Atmosphere Models</a></h1><p>ModelHostess provides an extensive database of handpicked and&nbsp;prescreened atmosphere models, hostesses, entertainers and even attractive wait staff&nbsp;that organizers can select from, invite and hire for their next party or special occasion. You get to set the guest list exactly to your liking and confirm that your models will be there. No more out of control guests lists, free admission or free drinks need to be promised. It is a simple solution to a decades old issue. You actually get to visualize the crowd before the event even takes place.</p><p>Atmosphere models (also called Ambiance models) are hired to energize events that would otherwise be lifeless and boring. The duties of an atmosphere model are to interact with the crowd, look gorgeous and add energy to a party or special event. Appearance models may be hired to accompany clients to red carpet events, business engagements or even be a promotional model for convention styles settings. While appearance models are hired for their undeniable good looks, ModelHostess makes it a point to interview and screen each model before accepting them into our database to ensure their personality has a certain likability. After all, atmosphere and appearance &nbsp;models should have wit as well as good looks. </p><p>Atmosphere models can also be hired by large night clubs and private party planners.

<p>'Tis the season: Lines, lines everywhere. But shoppers are getting better at putting that down time to good use, studies show, by shopping online with their phones. <a href="http://www.socialcentiv.com/">SocialCentiv</a>, whose software helps companies find customers on Twitter, has some holiday marketing tips to help marketers maximize their e-commerce and mobile campaigns, and ring up more jingle.<br></p><p>Ad spending is an area where retail marketers need to catch up: They play Scrooge with dollars designated for mobile e-commerce campaigns, while favoring traditional marketing.<br></p><p>Retail sales in the U.S. in the November and December holiday season should clock in at $885.7 billion, up 5.7 percent over the same period in 2014, according to <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Happy-Holiday-Season-Expected-Retailers/1012898">eMarketer</a>. E-commerce should account for 9 percent of total U.S. retail sales in this holiday season, up from 8.3 percent in 2014, eMarketer forecasts.</p><p>Some of the biggest change in retail shopping is coming from consumers increasing willingness to buy via mobile devices like smartphones. By the end of 2016, one out of every four dollars that retailers generate through e-commerce will originate on a mobile device, eMarketer projects.</p><p>Yet recent data suggests that many companies have yet to shift enough of their marketing efforts to the Internet, especially the mobile arena, according to Bernard Perrine, co-founder and CEO of SocialCentiv.<br></p><p>In 2014, of every hour that U.S. consumers spent watching, listening to or reading media like television, radio, print publications or the Internet, they spent more than 14 minutes on mobile devices, Perrine says. But a recent Kleiner Perkins <a href="http://www.kpcb.com/blog/2015-internet-trends">report</a> shows that only 8 percent of U.S. advertising spending last year went toward ad platforms like smartphones and tablets.</p><p>The Kleiner Perkins data show that U.S. advertisers were pouring too much money into media like print and television in 2014, because their audiences had shifted toward wireless devices, Perrine notes.</p><p>That is an opportunity for marketers who know how to capitalize.</p><p><b>Four points to success</b><br></p><p>There are four basic elements to maximizing a companys marketing efforts online and on mobile, according to Jason Dove, SVP of sales and marketing at SocialCentiv:</p><p></p><ul><li><b>Set goals.</b> As <a href="https://www.ometria.com/blog/ecommerce-marketing-strategy-blueprint">Ometria</a> has noted, companies must know what theyre looking to achieve in a campaign and have a reliable measuring stick to help determine when theyve hit the mark, Dove says.<br></li><li><b>Know thy customer</b>. This means doing in-depth research on demographic questions like age and income, along with learning where a businesss clientele hang out in cyberspace and what devices they use when they visit.<br></li><li><b>Attract and convert</b>. A strong understanding of who buys a companys products or services, and why they purchase, will inform the methods the business uses to spur interest in prospective customers, Dove explains. Its important to optimize Web pages to increase the odds of transactions getting done, with Ometria suggesting steps such as replacing carousel images with static ones on the home page.<br></li><li><b>Measure and adjust</b>. Every business is unique, as is every campaign it runs to bring in new customers. It is important to keep close tabs on the results of every marketing push, and to make changes as things proceed to get the best bang for the corporate buck, Dove adds.<br></li></ul><p></p><p><b></b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Follow up, personalize</b><br></p><p>With consumers being bombarded with dozens or hundreds of marketing messages daily, marketers must go the extra mile to ensure their pitches are relevant to individuals in their target market. The stronger the emotional connection an individual feels with a brand, the better the chances he or she will buy, Dove says.</p><p>And since even the most loyal customers cant respond to every marketing outreach, companies are well served by following up to help ensure their message gets heard. Research <a href="http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/mobile-marketing-and-the-future-of-e-commerce/626602">suggests</a> that selective persistence can boost response rates, but the key is to avoid overdoing it.<br></p><p>E-commerce and mobile marketing are full of nuances, many of which can help make or break a sale, Perrine adds. This is why companies can benefit from getting outside expertise on the ins and outs of this emerging endeavor.<br></p><p>A strong marketing partner can help make the cash register chime, he says. And during the holidays in particular, that is music to a CEOs ears.<br></p><p><b>About SocialCentiv</b></p><p>SocialCentiv is a full-service Twitter marketing company that helps companies find new customers on Twitter with their patented software. Using a business keywords and geographic location, SocialCentiv combs Twitter in real time looking for relevant Tweets that express an intent to purchase a product or service.

<p>A fairly complicated cocktail of rules has developed with regard to the packaging and labeling of statelegal marijuana. Why is it so complicated? In part because the subject matter is such: marijuana is lawful in some states merely for medicinal purposes, in others for adult recreation as well. In either case it may be sold simply as cannabis or as another product infused withcannabis. Making allowances for all that, though, some of the rules seem quite arbitrary, and in sum they may all be onerous to many actual or potential entrepreneurs. Indeed, one might take the cynical view that these rules serve as a back-door effort at repeal. After all, in many states such legalization as has come about has resulted from a grassroots movement and initiative/referendum, in essence from an end-run around the usual political/governing process. So (thinks the cynic), the governing class may be striking back by undermining legalization or limiting itsconsequences. That is the kind of thinking one encounters now and then in the NORML Blog. And one has to say, the burdens imposed on would-be entrepreneurs by onerous packaging rules fit all-too-nicely into this suspicion. Consider Nevada. The voters there approved of Ballot Question 9 back in November 2000. But due to bureaucratic feet-dragging of impressive proportions, the states Department of Health and Human Services did not announce its regulations until April 1, 2014, and only on July 31 of this year did the first dispensary in the state finally open itsdoors to authorized patients. Given such a long head start it may not be a surprise that Nevadas bureaucrats have developed an extensive list of rules on packaging, which may be found here: Chapter 453A. The rules provide, for example, that marijuana-infused products, whether in solid or liquid form, must be packaged in plastic which is 4 millimeters or more in thickness and must be heat-sealed without an easy-open tab, dimple, corner or flap  and that if they are in liquid form they must be sealed using a metal crown cork-style bottle cap. There are also rules on maximum unit supply (no single unit of marijuana packaging can include more than 2.5 oz. of the stuff) and there are nine required disclosures for the labeling. Yet the hypothesis that such regulations are the work of clever reactionaries might itself be too clever and inadequately charitable. Kris Krane, principal and managing partner at 4Front Advisors, a thoughtleader in the legal marijuana industry, takes a non-conspiratorial view. He says that the extensive and sometimes arbitrary regulations have come about because regulators just dont understand the issues, and there isnt a lot of precedent for them to drawon. Images, Logos, Resemblances A number of states have rules designed to prevent the newly legal industry from appealing to children, getting them hooked young. Massachusetts, for example, provides that edible marijuana infused products shall not bear a reasonable resemblance to any product available for consumption as a commercially available candy. Also, the containers shall carry no cartoons or images other than the logo of the Registered Marijuana Dispensary. | CLS Holdings Inc. Krane believes that these provisions reflect an understandable concern. Politicians, regulators, have all grown up in the environment of the war on drugs, receiving the message that pot is evil. Also, there were egregious examples of both the alcohol and tobacco industries appealing to children. Were not that far removed from Joe Camel or the Budweiserfrogs. Krane does not believe such rules are really necessary, though. A lot of players in the marijuana industry are a lot more socially conscious than their counterparts in tobacco or alcohol, although the legislators dont recognize this. And the culture has changed in terms of what is acceptable to direct to children even in the absence oflegislation. Jeff Binder, the CEO of CLS Holdings USA (OTCQB: CLSH) agrees with the various states legislatures and the general public that marijuana purchase and use must be exclusively an adult decision. "I believe marijuana should never be sold to anyone under the age of 18. As an industry standard, retailers should card buyers. All packaging should bechild-resistant." Binder also believes, though, that given that, I dont see a reason why a retailer could not appropriately use cartoons or cartoon-type images on a package. These images can very well appeal to adults, and they can convey something of the nature of theproduct. Contention in Michigan One of the difficulties with giving any comprehensive view of the patchwork of regulations state by state is the speed with which everything is changing. Thus, in using any simple tabular format one would be in a quandary as to what to say about, for example, Michigan. So let us give a non-tabular, prosaic account of recent developmentsthere. In 2008, voters passed proposal 1 with 63% of the vote, making Michigan the 13th state to legalize medical marijuana. The law (amended in certain respects in 2012) protected residents with certain qualifying medical conditions, and protected their caretakers, from prosecution for growing, possessing, or using, marijuana. As Michigan state legislator Jeff Irwin explained in an interview recently, this law was not designed to create a commercial market in the stuff, but a market did emerge, because some of the caregivers produced overages in their harvesting, reaping more than their own patients could consume, and the caregivers with surplus on their hands believed they were entitled to sell the overage to other appropriatecaregivers-patients. Two recent judicial decisions blew holes in this young market, and the legislature got to work in 2015 trying to patch those holes. As of the time that Irwin spoke with a reporter for MJINews, three bills had passed the state House of Representatives, and each awaited action by the Senate. The pending bill most relevant to the issue of product labelling and packaging is HB 4209, which creates a system of lawful cultivators, processors, and retailers for medical marijuana. With regard to the retailers, it stipulates that they shall have their entire product tested and labelled with test results regarding potency, freedom from contaminants, etc. The details of this are going to be left to the state Licensing and Regulatory Affairs Department(LARA). | CLS Holdings Inc. On the question of how he, as one of the influential supporters of the ongoing legalization process in Michigan, would regard rules banning cartoon images and the like, Irwin replied: What the proposal says is that the retailer must package the product in a way that is not intended to attract children. The details of that commitment, too, will be left toLARA. Odd Rules Then there are rules that seem to have come into existence simply by regulatory inertia. Regulators gotta regulate in much the same way that fish gottaswim. Some states, and Nevada again may serve as an example, require that labelling say something about the aroma, which in the technical language of the new industry is called the terpenoid profile. Some states, such as New Mexico, demand that labels have a use by or freeze by date for products capable of supporting the growth of infectious, toxigenic, or spoilage microorganisms. Now that rule could be grist for a conspiracy theorist. After all, adults do not need a label to inform them that dead plants, left alone for an indefinite length of time, will eventually come to change in appearance and odor. This is no truer of marijuana than it is of tobacco or lettuce. As Krane puts it, marijuana is plant matter. If you leave your marijuana cigarette sitting around unprotected for ten years it will probably look pretty gross at the end of that time. The specific expiration dates appearing in regulations and packages are totally unscientific though. What follows is a state-by-state review, with all the states that have legalized at least some possession or consumption of marijuana listed alphabetically. The discussion of each states rules and regulations is accompanied by a link to a more official and complete source of information. This précis will touch repeatedly on the themes mentioned already. | CLS Holdings Inc. Through the Alphabet ALASKA: This states successful initiative authorized the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to go into the marijuana-regulating business, pending the development of a separate Marijuana Control Board. The board (either one) is empowered to develop labeling requirements for the products to be sold by marijuana establishments, as well as reasonable restrictions on [their] advertising and display. Detailed regulations along these lines are expected by November 24, 2015. ARIZONA: The Department of Health Services has developed rules under the 2010 Arizona Medical Marijuana Act. It has little to say about packaging or labelling issues. But in 2013, Rep. Kimberly Yee, RPhoenix, complained that some marijuana infused products were being packaged in ways that looked similar to familiar products. So the legislature passed a law restricting the packaging of such edibles to a white background with black text. CALIFORNIA: Medical marijuana has no state-law packaging rules in California, although it does have guidelines for the security and non-diversion of marijuana grown for medical use. The City and County of San Francisco, meantime, has plenty of rules: such as that an edible cannabis product that is made to resemble a typical food product (i.e. brownie, cake) must be in a properly labeled opaque (non see-through) package before it leaves the dispensary. It is kind of the City fathers to inform the stoners parenthetically of the meaning of the wordopaque. COLORADO: Colorado allows both medical and recreational marijuana, with its packaging regulations focusing on child resistance and opacity. The rules on labeling are straightforward: no false or misleading statements, labeling text at least 1/16th of an inch, in English, and labeling for edible products must include all ingredients. CONNECTICUT: Allows medical marijuana use. Label must include serial number, date dispensed, quantity, name and registration number of the patient and caregiver, name of certifying physician, and a prominently printed expiration date based on the producers recommended conditions of use and storage that can be read and understood by the ordinaryindividual. DELAWARE: Label must include the name of the strain, the batch and quantity, details indicating freedom from contamination and the level of active ingredients, and the words, This product is for medical use only, not forresale. GEORGIA: Through legislation signed in the spring of 2015, Georgia allows some seriously ill patients to possess oils containing small amounts of THC. Unfortunately, the bill does not provide for lawful in-state production or distribution, so it is not clear than many patients will actually gain access in this way. The state is considering changes to the act, but regulations about packaging and labeling still seem distant. HAWAII: Packages must be child resistant and opaque, clearly labelled with the phrase For medical use only, and contain information about the contents and potency. Separately, Hawaii makes provision for lozenges that that may be packaged such that one dose, serving, or single wrapped item contains no more than ten milligrams of THC. | CLS Holdings Inc. ILLINOIS: Under its Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act, the state has an elaborate set of labeling requirements. The label for any marijuana infused product must include all ingredients of the item, including any colors, artificial flavors, and preservatives, listed in descending order by predominance of weight, the date of manufacture, a use by date, and two distinct warnings. Buyers must be warned both that the item is not a food on the one hand and that it is intended for consumption by registered qualifying patients only on theother. LOUISIANA: Passed legislation legalizing medical marijuana in 1991, but then failed to follow up as to legal/regulatory framework. On June 29, 2015, Gov. Bobby Jindal signed Senate Bill 143 in order to create such a framework. But this too involved kicking the can forward. The law essentially mandates the creation of regulations by the Louisiana Board of Pharmacy and instructs the BoP about the groups from whom it should seek input before it does so. So no specific packaging/labelling rules exist yet. MAINE: Allows medical marijuana, and treats labeling and packaging as evidence of compliance with a law that limits possession and dispensing to 2.5 oz. per qualifyingpatient. MARYLAND: Allows medical marijuana. Requires a safety insert with all marijuana sold that will include information on methods of administering the product, potential dangers, and appropriate service or treatment for problematic usage. Also, labels require three distinct warnings: that consumption cam impair your ability to drive a car or operate machinery, that the product should be kept away from children, and that possession remains illegal under federal law. MASSACHUSETTS: Medical marijuana is lawful, with child resistant (and opaque) packaging, without images other than the registered marijuana dispensarys (the RMDs) own logo, presumably a consequence of anti-Joe-Camel sentiment. Massachusetts law creates two distinct sets of labeling regulations, one for marijuana-infused products (MIPs), and the other for marijuana as such. The two sets of rules have a lot of points in common, but only the MIPs are required to include on the label the date of product creation and a recommended use by or expiration date. Both sorts of product must contain the following statement: This product has not been analyzed or approved by the FDA. There is limited information on the side effects of using this product, and there may be associated health risks. Do not drive or operate machinery when under the influence of this product. KEEP THIS PRODUCT AWAY FROMCHILDREN. MICHIGAN: Allows for medical marijuana under the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act (that is the official spelling in Michigan, as in New York), but the state currently has no applicable packaging or labeling laws. For more information on Michigan, see the prefatory essay above. MINNESOTA: Allows medical marijuana, subject to an unusually complicated set of packaging and labeling regulations. Minnesota provides for example that the packaging must not bear a reasonable resemblance to any commercially available product and must not depict images other than the medical cannabis manufacturers business name logo. Further, the trade name must not be confusingly similar to that | CLS Holdings Inc. of any existing noncannabis product. Furthermore, the label must include: The patients registry identification number, name, and date of birth; the name and date of birth of the designated registered caregiver if applicable; the name of the patients patient or legal guardian, if listed on the registry verification; the patients address; the name and address of the manufacturer whence the cannabis came; the cannabis chemical composition; the recommended dosage; directions for use of the product; all ingredients of the product shown with common or usual names, including any colors, artificial flavors, and preservatives, listed in descending order by predominance of weight; date of manufacture and batch number; and two notices. One of the notices is to run as follows (with the caps): "Thisproducthasnotbeenanalyzedor approvedby the United States Food and Drug Administration. There is limited information on the side effects of using this product, and there may be associated health risks. Do not drive or operate heavy machinery when under the influenceofthisproduct.KEEPTHISPRODUCTOUTOF REACHOFCHILDREN. Theotheristo read: "Thismedical cannabisisfortherapeuticuseonly.Diversionofthis productis unlawfuland may resultin the revocationofthepatient'sregistration." MONTANA: Allows for medical marijuana under Initiative 148, approved by the states voters on November 2, 2004. Yes, eleven years ago. Amended on May 14, 2011 in ways that make access very limited, and forbids commercial sale. That amending statute has itself been challenged in the courts, but while the situation sorts itself out, there are no labeling or packaging rules. NEVADA: Some of its rules were discussed in the prefatory essay above. Labels must include: The name if the medical marijuana establishment and its  registration certificate number; lot number; date of harvest; date of final testing; date on which the product was packaged; cannabinoid profile and potency levels and terpenoid profile as determined by an independent testing laboratory; the expiration date; the quantity of marijuana sold. Nevada is less specific than some states about the size of the print and such matters, but it does provide that this information must be in legibleEnglish. NEW HAMPSHIRE: Leaves a large role for industry self-regulation. Its alternative treatment centers are mandated to provide a plan of their own for safe and accuratepackaging. NEW JERSEY: The Public Health Services branch of Health and Senior Services administers New Jerseys medical marijuana program. New Jersey distinguishes two sorts of Alternative Treatment Center (ATC), the dispensaries and the plant cultivation sites. The latter shall place a legible, firmly affixed label containing [certain information] on each package it sends to the former. The label must provide the name and address of the ATC-cultivation, the quantity, the date of packaging, a sequential serial number, lot number, and bar code, the cannabinoid profile, including the THC level not to exceed 10 percent, a statement of whether the marijuana is of low, medium, or high strength, a statement that it is not for resale, and a list of any ingredients other than marijuana contained in the packaging. | CLS Holdings Inc. The law also provides that the label must say, This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. NEW MEXICO: This state requires a fairly standard list of labelling items, along with a use by or freeze by date for products capable of supporting the growth of infectious, toxigenic, or spoilage microorganisms. NEW YORK: The states medical marijuana regulations provide that when an entity applies to become a registered organization, it mustsubmit: a standard operating procedure manual for all methods used from cultivation of the medical marihuana through packaging, sealing and labeling of each lot of medical marihuana product. The procedures shall include use of good agricultural practices (GAPs) and must conform to all applicable laws and rules of New York State. Standard operating procedures shall be able to be validated to demonstrate that the applicant will be able to produce and dispense consistent and reproducible medical marihuana product such that, for each form of each brand produced, there is homogeneity, absence of contamination and reproducibility of the brand profile in eachlot. OREGON: The state has allowed medical marijuana since 1998, via its Ballot Measure 67, and recreational marijuana since Election Day 2014. The latter law took effect in July 2015. Its still-temporary rules on medical marijuana involve various posters and flyers that must be in plain sight or distributed to customers of facilities. One of the required flyers may be found here. Temporary rules on recreational marijuana also rely on posters and flyers at the point of sale. Separately, they provide that containers must be child resistant, and must not be packaged in a way that is attractive to minors. RHODE ISLAND: Allows for the distribution of medical marijuana at compassion centers. Every new registered qualifying patient who registers at a compassion center is provided with a FAQ sheet designed by the Health Department that explains the limitations on the right to use medicinal marijuana under state law. The packaging of useable marijuana must inform patients of the name of the strain, batch, and quantity as well as a statement that the product is for medicinal use only and is not for resale. VERMONT: Provides for the medicinal use of marijuana within what the law describes as a bona fide health care professional-patient relationship which must in most cases have existed for at least six months before the professional may recommend the use of cannabis and qualify the patient. The product is to be labeled so as to make it clear that the state does not attest to the medicinal value of the stuff, and that it is not for resale. It shall also identify the strain of marijuana, and the weight in gram or ounce units. The strains shall reflect the properties of the plant. | CLS Holdings Inc. WASHINGTON: Allows for the use of either medicinal or recreational marijuana. The Evergreen States is unusual in providing detailed specifics about the display of a sample jar. The legislation specifies: A processor may provide a retailer free samples of usable marijuana packaged in a sample jar protected by a plastic or metal mesh screen to allow customers to smell the product before purchase. The sample jar may not contain more than three and one-half grams of usable marijuana. The sample jar and the usable marijuana within may not be sold to a customer and must be returned to the licensed processor who provided the usable marijuana and sample jar. With that kind of attention to detail it is perhaps to be expected that the legislation also specifies six distinct warnings that must be included in material provided to customers at the retail level: This product has intoxicating effects and may be habit forming; smoking is hazardous to your health; there maybe risks associated with consumption of this product; should not be used by women that are pregnant or breast feeding; for use only by adults twenty-one and older; Keep out of reach of children; marijuana can impair concentration, coordination, and judgment, do not operate a vehicle under the influence of this drug; and a statement that discloses all pesticides applied to the marijuana plants and growing medium during production andprocessing. Consumers of marijuana infused products are to receive another set of warnings, such as When eaten or swallowed, the intoxicating effects of this drug may be delayed by two or more hours. Apparently so you do not feel cheated during that period. WASHINGTON, D.C.: Our nations capital has allowed medicinal use since passage of the Marijuana for Medical Treatment Initiative of 1999. Pertinent rules on the labeling and packaging of medical marijuana were published in the DC Register on December 2,2011. These rules include a fairly standard list of what has to be on such a label: name of cultivation center, name of dispensary, quantity, cannabinoid profile, other ingredients, etc. Further, D.C. wants the label to include a list of all chemical additives, including but not limited to non-organic and organic pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers that were used in the cultivation and production of the medical marijuana. The label shall not include Any seal, flag, crest, coat of arms, or other insignia likely to mislead the qualified patient to believe that the product has been endorsed, made, or used by the District government.  In 2014, Initiative 71, supporting adult recreational use, passed with the support of close to 65% of voters. This seems not yet to have given rise to new rules as to packaging or labeling. | CLS Holdings Inc. Final Thoughts The hobbled-together sound of many of these regulations, taking them state-by-state and still more if they are considered as a whole, is inconvenient for entrepreneurs, who of course value clarity and predictability. CLS Holding has proposed that manufacturers themselves could pick up the mantle here, creating a standard for labeling that would live up to all of these requirements and that would empower consumers and ease the minds of apprehensiveoutsiders. In the words of the CEO of CLS, Jeff Binder, There will come a time when the federal government will come in to regulate, because they want to be able to tax cannabis, and they'll want to be able to control its interstate shipment. By creating industry wide standards, we're preparing for that day." Molly Poiset, an award-winning chef known for reinventing the edible, expressed a similar view in a recent e-mail exchange. She has an especial concern with the adults-only nature of marijuana-infused foods. "Child safe packaging and labeling, she said, is a critical factor in paving the way for cannabis and cannabis-infused edibles to become a trusted and respected consumer product."<br></p>

<div><p>The joy of owning a pet is a feeling many of us know well, especially for those dedicated animal lovers who consider their furry friends another member of the family. With the holidays approaching, its soon time to start finding the right gifts for your loved ones. If your friend or neighbor is a dog owner, POOF is an amazing gift that makes the task of dog walking just a little bit easier. POOF is the very first <a href="http://www.thenoblo.com/" target="_blank">reusable dog waste bag</a>&nbsp;that is used to quickly scoop up waste, cinch it, and then drop it in the toilet at home. This eco-friendly alternative to traditional dog waste bags (dog poop of the 21st century!) is a must-have for all dog owners this holiday season!</p><br><p><img width="300" alt="poofpng" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/112592/poof-png" height="225" title="Image: http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/112592/poof-png"></p><br><p>With other dog waste pickup bags, once you scoop up the waste, it gets tied up and tossed in the trash.

There is a controversial conversation starting about the "biodegradable" factor with the biodegradable bags - that they too lay entombed in landfills for thousands of years awaiting the conditions necessary to biodegrade. While that happens, dog waste is poisoning our planet and so it needs to be treated as human waste is. </p><br><p><img width="400" alt="poof graphicpng" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/112592/poof-graphic-png" height="300" title="Image: http://s3.amazonaws.com/mprgenieproduction/binaries/112592/poof-graphic-png"></p><br><p>POOF makes it simple to get rid of dog waste in an environmentally friendly way  it lies flat like a disk so the waste can be scooped up and then cinched closed with the attached tie. When cinched, the bag is leak-proof and has a long cord making it easy to carry home. Once home, the bag gets un-cinched and the waste is dropped into the toilet. POOF rinses easily and dries quickly so its ready for the next use. Not only is it an eco-friendly way to scoop up poop, it also saves dog owners money since they do not have to buy plastic bag refills!</p><br><p>POOF is available for purchase for $18.00 online at Amazon.com and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thenoblo.com/" target="_blank">www.thenoblo.com</a>.

<p>                 </p><p><b>Goodway Group Offers Tips on Maximizing the Effectiveness of Digital Holiday Ads</b></p><p>JENKINTOWN, PA  (Dec. 02, 2015)  Just like Santa has a holiday checklist, Goodway Group does too. The programmatic ad tech firm is delivering a handy checklist of what brands need to consider when deploying digital ads during the holiday season.</p><p>Digital experiences represent 48 percent of the total time consumers spend with media. So it is imperative to develop a plan that focuses on how and where consumers are absorbing information, says Jay Friedman, chief operating officer of the Goodway Group. Its important to capitalize on these consumer wants and needs, especially during the holiday season, to ring up the jingle.</p><p>With that in mind, Goodway Group offers five key checklist items for digital advertising:</p><p>1.  &nbsp; <b>Specialized keywords in pay-per-click (PPC).</b> Holiday shoppers are now searching for items and categories that they dont normally search for during the rest of the year. Relying only on data from previous months to create a plan simply wont take into account the unique searches that happen this time of year.<br> </p><p>2.  &nbsp; <b>Place a heavy focus on mobile.</b> Larger retailers should place a heavy focus on mobile, as it is on par with desktop for reaching a desired target market segment. Have consideration for those who search their smartphone while in the very act of shopping!<br> </p><p>3.  &nbsp; <b>Give enough lead time.</b> Use specialized keywords in PPC for search traffic, and get advertising started with enough lead time in order maximize its potential. How much lead time? At least a week.</p><p>4.  &nbsp; <b>Start media now.</b> Advertisers are sorely mistaken when they think that turning advertising on means more sales and turning it off means less sales. There is at least one week of lag time in behavioral effect from advertising.<br> </p><p>5.  &nbsp; <b>Publishers should limit excessive use of ads.</b> Publishers should not overload their site with too many ads or nonrelevant messaging. It will give short-term gain but hurts in the long run, because frustrated site visitors may turn to ad-blockers for relief.</p><p>###&nbsp;</p><p><b>About Goodway Group</b></p><p>Goodway Group is a leading managed-services programmatic partner to local, regional and Fortune 500 brand agencies.

<p>In the middle of the United States is an auto repair shop built on pride, quality, and honesty.</p><p>Almost 14 years in the making, Dan Harrington, the Cottman Man of Des Moines and his crew at Cottman Transmissions and Total Auto Care, have worked hard to build a reputation to be proud of. But good reviews on Google and the Better Business Bureau's A+ rating doesn't come close to how it was done.</p><p>After assembling a professional crew and buying the best equipment, tools, and computers to perform the work on all domestic and foreign cars and light trucks, Harrington has built his business one car at a time -- done right, with consideration and courtesy from those who really care.</p><p>Today he wants to prove it. One of his more demanding customers, Katie Becker, came to Cottman over two years ago, driving a 2001 Suburban that had a lot of miles on it. Katie owns a company called "Move the Dog," for which she drives across the country over and over again, moving rare dogs to breeders, trainers, and their owners on time and safely, and then heads back home.</p><p>Katie was very familiar with tow companies. She had towing insurance for a long time and she used it. She had so many tow bills, her tow insurance companies always dropped her at renewal. Of course, if you travel 10,000 miles a month in a 14-year-old Suburban with over 400,000 miles on it, you expect to have the occasional problem. Or so she thought.</p><p>Enter Cottman of Des Moines. Dan and the crew are used to working on demanding customer's cars; even the owner's race cars get repaired by his crew. After over 78 races lasting over 35 minutes each on road courses, they proved that they know how to keep a car running when it's pushed to its limits.</p><p>"My crew told me that she should go buy a new truck," said Dan Harrington. "After all, we rarely see a Suburban with over 300,000 miles on it, and never one with over 400,000 and still running strong. But driving this cross country? OK, I admit it: I love a challenge, and gladly took this one."</p><p>"I sat down with Katie and explained what we could do to reduce her breakdowns by doing preventive maintenance, but it would also involve her giving us feedback. This would lead to phone calls day and night for everything from a newly discovered leak to a vibration or check engine light that was flashing or staying on."</p><p>"I still remember that phone call: She was about as far east as you can go in the U.S. -- in Delaware. She said she was at a Firestone shop and they were recommending a repair. I was concerned; she'd just left our shop on Sunday only 6 days ago. We discussed the repair and decided it could wait until she came back home, since it wasn't a critical problem."</p><p>"Then I asked her, 'Why did you have to stop at Firestone? You just left my shop 6 days ago.' She told me she had to change her oil. 'But we did that on Saturday, remember?' I responded. Then she shocked me: She told me she had over 5,300 miles on her Suburban since then. She'd been down to Texas, then over to Ohio, then South Carolina, then Delaware. Amazing!"</p><p>Katie's become quite the expert driver, now that she knows how to help Cottman keep her going. In return, the tow company didn't cancel her on renewal, because she hasn't had any tow bills in the last year! "We still get calls for advice or opinions at all hours. Katie now has her own code reader to help us diagnose trouble codes while she's on the road," said Dan.</p><p>Which led to a trip to Fastsigns, to get a bumper sticker made when her truck reached 400,000 miles, then 500,000, and last week, 600,000 miles. Katie's been booking more miles because she feels her truck is doing great, especially on long trips where she averages over 800 miles a day for 14 days in a row, like she did two weeks ago.</p><p>For those asking why she doesn't buy a new truck, think of it this way: She'd have to spend between $50,000 and $60,000 for a new 4x4 Suburban. Yes, she'd have a factory warranty, which would run out after only 10 months of driving. And all the parts on the new, out-of-warranty truck would cost a fortune to replace when they break or wear out.</p><p>She'd lose tens of thousands on depreciation, due to the miles she drives. And we already know that she'd wear out driveshafts, transfer cases, rear end bearings, driver's seats, and many other weird parts that most of us would never have to replace. But it's also about reliability getting those rare dogs to their homes, and then heading off to another part of the USA.</p><p>"OK, so it isn't all gravy for Cottman because we have to predict the future, but so far our crew has done a job that NASCAR teams could appreciate. No matter what, that truck has to take the checkered flag!" says Dan.</p><p>Her truck, named "Dimples," left the Cottman center with 604,000 miles on the odometer. What makes Katie smile? Falling in love with each of the dogs she delivers, and racking up miles on her truck faster than the USA government's national debt clock.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/robin8-production/robin8-production/e145d63b-6245-4e7e-82a2-affb61879372/Cottman_600kmiles.png" title="Image httpwwwucarecdncome145d63b-6245-4e7e-82a2-affb61879372"><br></p><p>About Cottman Transmission and Total Auto Care:</p><p>With locations across the U.S., Cottman Transmission and Total Auto Care is a transmission and auto repair brand that services almost any make or model vehicle, foreign or domestic.

SmarterTravel.com scoured destinations and deals for weeks to come up with bargains and overlooked off-peak destinations that are still great in winter. So, whether you're looking for a bucket-list beach destination or just wanting to hit the slopes, we've found some awesome deals both near and far.<br><br>Deals mentioned are not guaranteed and all prices are based on research done at the time of publication and are subject to change.<br><br>There's nothing quite like Christmas in the Big Apple. While hotel rates drop significantly after New Year's, you should still be able to find slashed rates compared to summer during the holidays and just before. Looking for even better prices? Average nightly hotel rates from January through March hover around $235 a night22 percent lower than the rest of the year. If you're going, check out the Unlock NYC campaign "Find a Winter Less Ordinary," which features tips for discovering unexpected icons and landmarks.<br><br>We found a hotel deal with Kimpton Hotels with prices at $170 a night from January through March 21, 2016. If you're too late on that deal, check out Hotel Week New York City from January 3 to 15, during which rooms are significantly discounted. Be sure to check out NYC Restaurant Week (January 18 through February 5), which offers three-course lunches for $25 and dinners for $38. Other deals include two-for-one theater tickets on select shows during NYC Broadway Week (January 19 through February 5) and NYC Off-Broadway Week (February 1 through 14).<br><br>Although in its peak season, flights to Australia are some of the cheapest we've seen. A strong American dollar also makes your stay there more affordable, so if Oz is on your bucket list, this is the time to do it right. Flights are inexpensive in part because American Airlines launches daily service from LA to Sydney on December 17, and San Francisco via Qantas on December 20. These are the lowest fares we've seen in a while, according to SmarterTravel Deals Editor Patricia Magaña.<br><br>This is also Sydney's summer, when amazing weather (little humidity, lots of sunshine) makes it a great escape from the traditional holiday chill with the extra treat of beautiful New Year's fireworks. Domestic travel within Australia is inexpensive with Jetstar making a multi-destination vacation affordable. Don't miss Australia Day at the end of January and Mardi Gras in February.<br><br>Round trip flights with flexible dates from Qantas between LAX and Sydney can be found for under $1,300 in December, February, and March. Hotels average around $200 or $300 per night, and Qantas offers point deals when you book through the airline. Adina Apartments are abundant in the city, with affordable rates and special offers for winter travel. Check out the 4-Day Sydney Discovery deal with Qantas for a harbor-view vacation by boat.<br><br>December is a semi-popular time to visit before the busy spring season, but hotel deals and flights can still be found through February and early March, making the warm temperatures and attractive price a great winter escape. Most beaches have free access and hotel deals can be found through promotions either just before or just after the holidays. The closest major airport to Tulum is Cancun (about a two-hour drive), so you're likely to find a cheap flight to the major airport, but also a secluded beach vacation.<br><br>Frontier, Spirit, and United all are offering cheap round-trip tickets from major U.S. cities. For hotels, we found lots of pre- and post-holiday promotions. Check out Diamante K and Posada Yum Kin's ongoing discounted hotel rates.<br><br>Both San Diego and Los Angeles are in their quieter tourism seasons, so you'll find slashed hotel prices but you'll still be able to enjoy the warm weather. It's also whale-watching season in San Diego with lots of discounts to spot them. Hit both for a mini-road trip vacation (driving, you can get between the two cities in about two hours if you time it right). It's also a quick and inexpensive flight.<br><br>We found inexpensive flights to both L.A. and San Diego outside of holiday travel days December through February from the East Coast for under $500 round-trip. Check out JetBlue's deals from Boston to Los Angeles for extra savings. Save 15 percent for fall and winter stays through 2015 with Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts. Other major hotel chains are also offering deals for both San Diego and Los Angeles through winter.<br><br>If you're craving an island getaway, Barbados is popular but never over-crowded compared to more visited Caribbean destinations. It's also a great bargain this winter as it is usually one of the pricier islands to get to. A new direct route from Boston on JetBlue, which started November 7, has contributed to decreased flight prices to the island, making it more attainable than ever.<br><br>Last minute holiday? There are dozens of pre-Christmas savings on hotels, and even some winter deals, like resort credits at Bouganvillea Beach Resort. Flights are under $200 one-way pre- and post-holidays from the East Coast as well, making Barbados a true go-to beach escape.<br><br>Peak season doesn't start until March (when a handful of music festivals kicks off before the heat gets unbearable), so package deals can be found during the winter months, when temperatures remain in the 60s and 70s. Barton Spring Pool stays a solid 68 degrees year-round and the city's surrounding golf courses are considerably less crowded. So if you're looking for an urban escape or some time outdoors, Austin makes for a perfect destination.<br><br>Hotels are less expensive and encourage travel during the holidays. Flight searches for December, January, and February from most major U.S. cities averaged under $200 round-trip.<br><br>Barcelona, Seville, Costa del Sol, Benidorm and the Canary Islands (where you can still go to the beach), all make great off-season Spanish destinations since the weather is warmer than most of Europe, staying between the 50s and the 70s depending on where you go. Favorable exchange rates and the launch of budget trans-Atlantic routes have made Europe overall more affordable this winter.<br><br>WOW Air offers unbelievably inexpensive flights from the U.S. East Coast to London, and from there, Spain is a short and cheap flight. Holiday package deals by low-cost carriers like EasyJet from the UK for Benidorm, Barcelona, Gran Canaria, and Lanzarote add to the savings. Non-budget airlines and hotels will also have significantly lower rates in winter. We found flights from the U.S. Midwest and East Coast round-trip to Barcelona under the $700 mark.<br><br>Celebrate winter in full swing in British Colombia's Vancouver. City hotel rates are low for non-skiers looking to enjoy an urban winter, and with extremely favorable exchange rates, Canada is more affordable than ever. Less than an hour and a half away, you'll find Whistler Mountain with hotels offering tons of package deals perfect for family getaways and a West Coast ski vacation. Don't miss Dine Out Vancouver between January 15 and 31 for a culinary showcase of the city.<br><br>Flights from West Coast are extremely cheap (under $200 round-trip) on Air Canada throughout winter, and can be found for under $500 from the Midwest and East Coast in January and February. The Four Seasons is offering a 20 percent off deal.<br><br>Colombia in general is a great budget destination and in particular during the winter months, when the weather is warm and mood is festive. High season ends in mid-January, so hotel rates then (which are already affordable) will be even less expensive.<br><br>Flights searched in January and February showed round-trip airfares under $500 departing from most major U.S. cities with connections in Bogota or direct from Miami. Hotel rates in high season average under $200 for a very comfortable hotel, with deals often around $100 per night or less after January. Check out some hotel deals HERE.<br><br>While temperatures are cold in Venice, most tourists stay away, which means you won't need to fight the crowds. Flights and hotel rates are ultra-low, and many locals will tell you Venice is even prettier with the occasional Dolomite snow. Be sure to check out Carnevale di Venezia (January 23 through February 9), which draws crowds during the weekends  the final weekend of the festival is the busiest and most exciting. If you're looking for something fun to do, check it out, as the celebration is one of Europe's most famous carnivals. But if you want to avoid the crowds altogether, go mid-week during this period or simply go before or after the festivities.<br><br>It's worth looking at taking a WOW Air flight from the East Coast to London then using an inexpensive carrier to get you to Italy, as you'll need to make a stop anyway. We found flights between London and Venice for under $50 round-trip with Ryanair throughout winter. Searches for non-budget carriers from the East Coast to Venice yielded results under $700 round-trip for the winter months, which is significantly cheaper than during high season, when flights average over $1,000 round trip. Hotel prices for winter for a comfortable hotel average between $100 and $200. Check out some of the city's hotel deals HERE.

The scene: New Orleans real estate does not get any more prime than the corner where the Napoleon House currently sits  and has since 1797. But it has "only" been the current restaurant for a little over a century; before that the building was the palatial home of the city's first freely elected mayor after the Louisiana Purchase. Napoleon House is so named because the mayor and his colleagues planned to offer it as a domicile for the exiled French emperor, but Napoleon never made it to the States. It is one of just four buildings in the city designated a National Historic Landmark.<div><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/robin8-production/robin8-production/6e610fd6-2088-4666-a987-b3169364593d/ScreenShot20151203at13957PM.png" title="Image: http://s3.amazonaws.com/robin8-production/robin8-production/6e610fd6-2088-4666-a987-b3169364593d/ScreenShot20151203at13957PM.png"><br><br>Sicilian immigrant Joseph Impastato opened a grocery store that quickly expanded into a bar and restaurant here in 1914, and until this year, it has been continuously owned by three generations of the Impastato family. When they decided to get out of the business, they approached New Orleans' most famous family of restaurateurs  and no one else  because it was important to them that the traditions be carried on. Today the largely unchanged Napoleon House is run by Ralph Brennan (Brennan's, Redfish Grill, Ralph's on the Park, Café B, etc.).<br><br>The corner lot sits just three blocks off Jackson Square in the heart of the French Quarter, and is instantly recognizable thanks to the distinctive sign hanging out front in the shape of Napoleon's iconic hat. The front door is cut into the corner on a 45-degree angle and is seemingly always open and welcoming, feeding directly into the very well-worn bar. It is said that the walls were last painted the first time they were ever painted, and you can still see some flecks of color here and there on the otherwise mostly exposed plaster. There are a few equally well-used tables in the barroom, whose walls are covered with all sorts of Napoleonic photos, paintings and posters, and there is a second full dining room beyond, though the prime seats much of the year are in the interior open-air garden courtyard, a fixture of New Orleans architecture. Here you can sit in the shade of potted palms and listen to the soothing gurgle of the fountain while enjoying a drink or meal in one of the city's most venerated settings.<br><br>The food: The Napoleon House serves a basic traditional slate of New Orleans' specialties including gumbo, jambalaya, po' boys, red beans &amp; rice and boudin sausage, along with appetizers and salads. But it is famous  really famous  for two things, its muffuletta sandwich and Pimm's Cup cocktails. These are the main reasons to visit, or even make a pilgrimage to the restaurant.<br><br>The muffuletta is a distinctive New Orleans invention, now served all over the city. It was famously invented at Central Grocery, written about previously in this column, where people still line up for it today (and have it shipped overnight nationwide). It is simply incredible, one of the very best sandwiches in the world. A variation on the "Italian," it contains cold cuts including ham, mortadella, salami, pepperoni, and cappicola, plus Swiss and provolone cheeses. What make it a muffuletta are the roll and relish. The word muffuletta is derived from a particular Sicilian bread, a flat round loaf about two inches high and 10-inches in diameter. Because it is roughly the size of a dinner plate, these sandwiches are almost always cut in quarters and sold by the half (two pieces) or whole (four). A half is enough for almost any single appetite, and a whole for sharing. The relish, called olive salad here and giardiniera elsewhere, is the vital ingredient, a chunky dressing of most or all of these: olives, celery, cauliflower, carrots, onions, hot and sweet peppers, capers, olive oil, vinegar, spices, and garlic. It seeps into and softens the bread and adds deliciousness throughout.<br><br>Both Central Grocery and Napoleon House were grocery stores opened by Sicilians, and it is believed that the latter was the third establishment in the city serving the sandwich. But Mr. Impastato thought it was better with the cheese slightly melted, so he served his warm. Today the Napoleon Hose is famously unique for regularly offering a warm version, and while controversial and hotly debated by locals, it has been this way for longer than most other muffuletta vendors have existed, and so has its own rich tradition. You do not go to Napoleon House for a muffuletta, you go for a warm muffuletta. It is an added bonus that it is a real restaurant where you can sit down and relax, not stand on a to-go line that can stretch out the door and worry about them running out of the dish, as Central Grocery does almost every day. It is warm, not hot, and personally, as an ardent muffuletta fan, I liked the idea and enjoy the softened cheese, but I still think the flavor at Central Grocery is slightly better. Both places make relish in-house using secret recipes, and I think the original has the edge. But that's splitting hairs, and this is a mind boggling sandwich: in muffuletta terms, it would be like serving the second best burger or pizza in the world. Sitting down at Napoleon House is also a great escape from the sometimes hectic French Quarter, and the waiter service, ambiance and the rest of the menu add a lot of reasons to stop here. Like many top restaurants in the City That Care Forgot, it is also a bargain.<br><br>The sandwich is also great to split four ways while trying some other things, and highlights of the menu include the excellent red beans &amp; rice, adorned with generous slices of andouille sausage. Another must try is the shrimp remoulade salad, a twist on a traditional local dish in that here the saucy mayo-based shrimp salad is served on a bed of creamy avocado, which is very refreshing. The gumbo is also quite good, a more orange-y version that is lighter than the chocolate-brown, dark roux style many places serve.<br><br>The bar shares equal billing with the restaurant, and do all the local classics like sazeracs and milk punch. But the star here is the Pimm's Cup  The Napoleon House claims to be the single largest volume dispenser of Pimm's in the nation, and second in the entire world only to the London bar that invented the cocktail. Originally a "health tonic," Pimm's No. 1 is a bottled spirit made of gin and a secret recipe of herbs and liqueurs meant as a digestive aid. A Pimm's Cup today is England's signature summer drink, and at the Napoleon House it is made of Pimm's No. 1 and sparkling lemonade, with a splash of 7-Up and a cucumber garnish, and it is quite refreshing, especially on hot days. They also always offer a seasonal variant. It was introduced here in the 1940s and has been madly popular ever since. While New Orleans prides itself as cocktail city with lots of great bars, almost everyone agrees that Napoleon House is the place to go for a Pimm's Cup.<br><br>What regulars say: "It may not be my very favorite muffuletta in the city, but it is my favorite place to eat a muffuletta in the city," said Jeff, New Orleans food expert and culinary tour guide for Confederacy of Cruisers bike tour company.<br><br>Pilgrimage-worthy?: Yes  Napoleon House offers a one-of-a-kind take on one of the world's best sandwiches, and is the single best place in the country to have a Pimm's Cup.<br><br>Larry Olmsted has been writing about food and travel for more than 15 years.

                 <p><b>NEWS</b></p>  <p>For Immediate Release&nbsp;</p>  <p><b>10 More Next-Generation Broadcasting Standards&nbsp;</b><b>Moving to ATSC 3.0 Candidate Standard Status</b></p>  <p><i>Four New Candidate Standards Approved;&nbsp;</i><i>ATSCs Technology Group Voting on Six Others</i></p>  <br>WASHINGTON, Dec. 7, 2015  Wrapping up a milestone year for next-generation television broadcasting, 10 more standards in the ATSC 3.0 suite of standards  including video encoding, Internet Protocol transport, electronic service guides and closed captioning  are moving toward Candidate Standard status this month, the Advanced Television Systems Committee announced today.<br><br>On the heels of approving the ATSC 3.0 transmission system Physical Layer Candidate Standard, the ATSC Technology Group responsible for next-generation broadcast standards has also just approved four subsystems  for electronic service guides, second-screen services, and video and audio watermarks  and elevated those items as ATSC 3.0 Candidate Standards. Technology Group members will be voting this month on ballots to elevate six other subsystems to Candidate Standard status.<br><br>With these latest Candidate Standards, the lions share of the overall ATSC 3.0 standard will be in place, as planned, by year-end, said ATSC President Mark Richer. Now that ATSC 3.0s core technologies have been defined, broadcast and consumer equipment manufacturers can proceed with confidence in building prototype gear to test and demonstrate the capabilities of next-gen broadcast television next year.<br><br>The four freshly-minted Candidate Standards are Companion Device, Service Announcement, Video Watermark and Audio Watermark:<br><br>SECOND-SCREEN SERVICES. The Companion Device Candidate Standard (A/338), which enables second-screen viewing, explains the communication between a primary device (typically a television) and a companion device (second screen, such as a tablet or smartphone). This candidate standard will allow moving interactivity from the primary screen to the companion device and providing additional services related to and synchronized with the broadcast.<br><br>ELECTRONIC SERVICE GUIDES. The Service Announcement Candidate Standard (A/332) describes encoding and transport of metadata used to create Electronic Service Guides. This will allow viewers to see an onscreen interactive listing of services offered by broadcasters.<br><br>ENABLING ENHANCED SERVICES. The Video Watermark (A/335) and Audio Watermark (A/334) Candidate Standards provide a means for broadcasters to insert metadata information into the video signal to send information for interactive services to ATSC 3.0 television receivers connected to multichannel video programming distributors.<br><br>The six subsystems beginning the Candidate Standard balloting process this month are: 1) Video Encoding, 2) Signaling, Delivery, Synchronization and Error Protection, 3) Captions and Subtitles, 4) Link Layer Protocol, 5) Service Usage Reporting, and 6) Audio/Video Watermark Payload:<br><br>The A/341 Video standard specifies how to encode video in the ATSC 3.0 system. It uses HEVC (H.265) video compression, the latest MPEG video coding standard, and provides support for 4K Ultra HDTV as well as future capabilities for transmission of information to enable wider color gamut, higher frame rates and high dynamic range.<br><br>The A/331 Signaling, Delivery, Synchronization and Error Protection standard represents the Internet Protocol (IP) based transport system for data/content in the ATSC 3.0 system, as well as the signaling metadata necessary for the receiver to assemble the services into a coherent whole. Support is provided for broadcast, broadband and hybrid delivery) as well as synchronization mechanisms.<br><br>The A/343 Captions and Subtitles standard covers how to encode and carry closed captioning. Captioning is treated and carried as a component of the television service. It is based on technology from W3C (IMSC1, similar to SMPTE Timed Text)<br><br>The A/330 Link Layer Protocol standard deals with how to package data from the transport layer into packets that are carried in the physical layer frames. It supports encapsulation of IP Packets, MPEG-2 TS packets and other future packet types.<br><br>The A/333 Service Usage Reporting standard defines enhanced audience measurement techniques, specifically the option to encapsulate and transport information about viewer usage of services from the receiver to the broadcaster.<br><br>The A/336 Audio/Video Watermark Payload standard describes the types and encoding of information and metadata carried in the audio and video watermarks.<br><br>A few remaining ATSC 3.0 subsystems, including audio, security and interactive capabilities, are expected to be balloted for TG3 voting as Candidate Standards in early 2016.<br><br>About the ATSC: The Advanced Television Systems Committee is an international, non-profit organization developing voluntary standards for digital television.

The detail within the fabric alone contains antibacterial properties as well as anti-odour, antimicrobial and antistatic features. Shield Headwears point of difference and truly unique feature is the protective design technology. The carefully designed fabric blocks harmful cell phone and wi-fi radiation by drastically reducing the negative effects that these emissions can cause.</p> <br> <p>The alarming statistics surrounding cell phone emissions have prompted Shield Headwear founders to investigate methods of protecting society from these inevitable dangers.

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beijing, December 10, 2015  Baidu, Chinas leading search engine, today announced that its autonomous car has successfully complete rigorous, fully autonomous road tests on streets with mixed conditions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The tests were conducted on Beijing city streets, ring roads, and highways on Sunday, December 6. The Baidu autonomous car is the first in China to have demonstrated full autonomy under comparable conditions, marking a milestone in Chinas autonomous driving effort. The road tests were carried out under highly complex road conditions, and the Baidu vehicle, a modified BMW 3 Series, completed the tests by incorporating a comprehensive set of driving behaviors, demonstrating an accurate understanding of the driving environment. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fully autonomous driving under mixed road conditions is a universal challenge, especially when it comes to Beijing with its complicated road conditions, said Wang Jing, SVP of Baidu and General Manager of Baidus newly established Autonomous Driving Business Unit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The test drive route started from Baidu Campus near Zhongguancun Science Park in Haidian District, drove onto the G7 highway to the Fifth Ring Road, arrived at Olympic Park in north central Beijing, and returned to Baidu Campus along the same route. During its 30-kilomter drive, the car demonstrated full autonomy and successfully executed driving behaviors including decelerating when detecting vehicles ahead, changing lanes, passing other cars, merging into traffic from on-ramps and exiting from off ramps, and taking turns. The car peaked at 100 km per hour during the run.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since 2013, Baidus Institute of Deep Learning, one of the three labs under Baidu Research, has been leading the autonomous driving project. The Baidu AutoBrain, the core of Baidus autonomous driving technology, includes highly automated driving (HAD) maps, positioning, detection, and smart decision-making and control. Baidus self-developed HAD maps record 3D road data to within a few centimeters of accuracy in vehicle positioning. With Baidus leading object recognition and environment perception technology, the car can detect, recognize, and follow other vehicles with high accuracy; recognize lanes in a roadway; and accurately gauge distance and velocity. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With its cutting-edge big data and AI, the Baidu AutoBrain showcases the companys advanced automotive vertical technologies. Baidu also leads the market in Internet mapping services. Baidus autonomous driving initiative is currently the only research project in China that has passed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_26262">IOS 26262</a> functional safety standard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>About Baidu</b></p><p>Baidu, Inc. is the leading Chinese language Internet search provider.

<h4><b>Fixed-mount strobes provide additional flexibility to suit narrow to wide webs</b></h4>  Saddle Brook, NJ Dec. 10, 2015 <a title="Link: http://www.unilux.com" target="_blank" href="http://www.unilux.com">Unilux</a>, the world leader in the design and manufacture of inspection lighting, has added UV inspection capability to its fixed-mount LED-3 andLED-1000 stroboscopic lights. Security printers and package converters can use the new sizes to create the best possible configuration for any web width and see special security codes or clear-coat adhesives that are only visible in the narrow UV light spectrum.<br><br>By using LED diodes instead of UV filters that cover the lenses of xenon-based strobes, Unilux eliminates the filter penalty. The penalty was the result of using the filter to remove various visible wave-lengths of light, thereby reducing the strobe lights output also in the UV spectrum. Without the need for a filter, UV diodes can emit full lighting power, thereby making them 10 times brighter than comparable xenon lights with filters. And because LED strobe lights eliminate the hot spots found in xenon lights, inspectors get a much more uniform view across the web.<br><br>The brighter light lets inspectors see details in the UV portion under ambient lighting conditions, said Mike Simonis, President, Unilux. Thats something they couldnt do before UV LEDs. At the same time, they can now inspect the entire width of the web at full production speed and make corrections when needed to improve their yield.<br><br>Multiple LED-3 units can be daisy-chained across a web, allowing printers and converters the flexibility to configure their lights according the specific needs of any production run. UV and standard inspection lights can be used simultaneously.<br><br>This dual-inspection capability meets a key customer demand, Simonis said. Printers and converters who have special inspection needs for banknotes and secure documents or for clear coatings on flexible packaging, for example, want to be able to see everything at the same time instead of using separate inspection stations for UV and full-spectrum. UV LED strobe lights let them take full advantage of LED technology and give them more flexibility for fine-tuning their inspection process.<br><br>Unilux Inc., headquartered in Saddle Brook, NJ, has 53 years of experience in designing and manufacturing industrial surface inspection lighting systems for the printing, converting, packaging, metals, paper manufacturing and textile industries. Unilux stroboscopic inspection lights range from handheld, battery-powered units for spot or narrow web inspection, maintenance and troubleshooting applications, to fixed-mounted units capable of inspecting surfaces up to 12m wide. Unilux products are easy to access and well supported by a global network of sales and service representatives in 58 countries throughout the world, along with service centers in North America, Europe, Thailand, China and India.<br><h5></h5><b>Photo Caption:</b><br>Without the need for a filter, UV diodes in the Unilux LED strobe light technology can emit full lighting power, thereby making them 10 times brighter than comparable xenon lights with filters.<br><br>Note: to Editors: Please Click Here for a high-resolution file of this LED-3 image or send an email to Stan Schnitzer (stan@theschnitz.com) and write Unilux LED-3 UV Image in the subject line.<br><br>

<p>The South African <a href="http://www.moreflavour.co.za/coffee-making-products/aeropresscoffeemaker/">AeroPress</a> champion 2016 is Winston Thomas from Origin Coffee Roasting&nbsp;Cape Town.</p><p>It doesnt come as much surprise when Origin scoops awards. This infamous speciality coffee roastery has been doing it for more than 8 years now with a bank volt full of SA Barista titles, Cup taster and Latte Art titles and now South African AeroPress title. But what is new are the faces, with youngsters like Winston, and Arno Els (SA Barista Champ finalist) it looks like the new generation at Origin are following in the footsteps of the old guard before.</p><p>Winston has been tipped as a future coffee star, after his 2nd place qualifier at the Cape Town regionals a few months back came after only 1 year in the coffee industry. Its fair to say that he probably makes more aeropress than anyone else in South Africa working behind the brew bar at Origin. His thirst for knowledge, passion for <a href="http://www.moreflavour.co.za">coffee makers</a> and coach-ability will take him far and we have great expectations for him on the world stage in Dublin.</p><p>The biggest surprise came from new comer Kurt Nilsen. A late independent entry on the evening surprised the entire coffee elite as he made his way to the finals with his very unconventional approaches, that seemed to bring unusual yet standout flavours from the coffee over his heat competitors. Needless to say Kurt became a coffee legend overnight.</p><p>Third place was Melanie Winter, from The Coffee Mag. The Coffee Mag is SAs leading speciality coffee publication, and had a strong presence with Mag producer Iain Evans making the Semis. The guys from The Coffee Mag were great hosts for the event along with the resident roastery FireBird.</p><p>The Coffee used was roasted by one of SAs best roasters Gerald Charles from Rock and Roller Coffee.</p><p>Charles: Guatemala SHG EP Huehuetnango Finca El Coyegual. Guatemala is one of the worlds top coffee origins and the eighth largest producer. This relatively small country boasts the most climatically diverse regions in the world. The soil, rainfall, humidity, altitude, and temperature are varied enough to produce seven distinct types of Guatemala Arabica coffee. Huehuetenango and Antigua coffees are well-known and highly rated.</p><p>Huehuetenango from the north highlands are exceptional coffees with distinct acidity and fruited flavours. Of the three non-volcanic regions, Huehuetenango is the highest and driest under cultivation. Due to the dry, hot winds that blow into the mountains from Mexicos Tehuantepec plain, the region is protected from frost. Cultivation  between 5000 and 5500 feet above sea level. A light medium to medium roast is suggested. This coffee has a sweet aroma, with a fruity start reminiscent of plums and a milk chocolate finish. Generally it is a great all round coffee. Flavour profile: Chocolate, Plum and Berries.</p><p>David Coleman, Wed expect to choose an African Coffee for the champs, and we cupped a few great Tanzanians and Kenyans along with this Gautamalan, but this one for me provided a great challenge for the brewers. Its had distinct acidity, sweetness and bitterness. This versatility would challenge them to choose a route, and go for a distinct flavour. Its was a real challenge for the brewers, and the results were radically varying coffees and lots of surprises in the cup. In the end Winstons mastery of the AeroPress and momentum gained through the rounds culminated in his eventual victory. Good Luck in Dublin Winston!</p><p>The final recipes were as follows:</p><p>Winstons 1st place:</p><p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp;  19 g coffee, medium to fine grind</p><p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Inverted method add 40g of 15C water.</p><p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Gentle Stir 30 seconds</p><p>4.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Add 180g 87C water</p><p>5.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Pressure plunge for 1min40sec using Aerobie paper filter</p><p>Kurts 2nd place:</p><p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Inverted method, 30% course grind from Bodum hand grinder, 70% finer grind from Baratza</p><p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;  1 measure of coffee on the Aeropress</p><p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Top up with 79C water.</p><p>4.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Stir and plunge for 1min</p><p>Mels 3rd place:</p><p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp;  23g course plunger grind coffee</p><p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Inverted add enough water for a 10 sec bloom.</p><p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Fill to the top with 92C water.</p><p>4.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Stir, cap it, swirl and plunge.</p><p>5.&nbsp; &nbsp;  BOOM!</p><p>The <a href="http://www.moreflavour.co.za/coffee-making-products/aeropresscoffeemaker/">South African AeroPress champs</a> was a fitting after party for the SA Barista champs, which had just crowned Wayne Oberholzer as the new Champ.</p><p>It brought together fans and competitors to celebrate the culmination of the SA 2015 coffee circuit. South Africa chooses its barista champs from 2015 to compete in 2016, and the AeroPress followed suit.</p><p>The evening as in true AeroPress form, a jol (translation blast or crackin Ireland) for all fans and coffee industry folk alike in an evening of coffee, craft beer and boere rolls. (South African hot dog of sorts). South Africans are growing as passionate about their coffee as they are about their rugby and braais. And this crew here are the heart of a fast growing culture of fun and flavour.</p><p>                                                                               </p><p>Look out Dublin, the AmaCoffees are coming!  @MoreFlavourSA</p>

If you want anyone to listen to you, you have to trump your spectators. This isnt because of Donald Trump, its modern-day nature.<br><br>We both are better off for knowing this but if we consisted of Donald Trump &amp; I this would be a language of business. When you let your eyes do the talking. You see this in his TV show Apprentice. Business is not psychology.<br><br>The English language is the most extensive of any language. If Trump is a synonym for sabotage, just like zoom is a synonym for vroom  or gaggle of idiots is a synonym for peanut gallery  then Trump is the Illuminati. Whats more fearful than Illuminati?<br><br>If Shakespeare created over 1,126 words in 15th century then I bear credence to cryptography as well as hieroglyphics. It is almost as if the Don wields the spell or superpower of Osmosis.<br><br>We fear poignancy; theres danger of veering in to downright saccharine depression.<br><br>Numbers &amp; letters codify existence down to human size  to make it comprehensible  to forget its unfathomable scale.<br><br>#IamDonald Trump. Not I as in my face. But the singular eye. The minds eye. You cannot see me nor Donald Trump so you apply truth however #IamDonaldTrump is a blanket statement to provoke catharsis. A mirage.<br><br>People who compare each other to each other are in the wrong. Once you take culture out of context, people will label you racist. Lets not be trite.<br><br>Why I dont support Trump is that the media pays for his advertisements. This isnt fair. This is fanfare. The public at large have become cyborgs whose physiological functioning is aided by or dependent upon a mechanical or electronic device. Technoscience. He feeds off our prudent nuances. News is fickle. People are fickle. We suffer from Say what you see disease.<br><br>Why is Trump winning although he doesnt pay for advertisements?<br><br>Because in the back of some minds, they think he is selling the American dream &amp; thus he must be just that. What is the American dream? Well ideally the image that Jesus Christ represents. To turn a loaf of bread into enough fish to feed a village.
<p>Do you feel torment in your tooth while biting sustenance?

It has been uncovered that such issues are more inclined to the people having unfortunate dietary patterns.</p><p>On the other hand, to treat distinctive sorts of dental issues, dental specialists make utilization of a wide assortment of methods and medicines to help patients in the most ideal way.</p><p>For instance, <a href="http://www.theparthasdentalclinic.org" target="_blank" title="Link: http://www.theparthasdentalclinic.org">Root channel treatment in bhubaneswar</a> is done to expel every one of the contaminations from the tooth.</p><p><b>What is root canal therapy?</b></p><p>It is a method used to expel contaminated tissues from root trench. Once the disease is uprooted, the unfilled channel is loaded with a bio perfect material and the upper piece of the cavity is loaded with a filling.</p><p><b>Why and when it is done?</b></p><p>This kind of treatment is done when tooth has rotted or gotten to be contaminated. Root channel counteracts further rot of the tooth and seals it with simulated bond.

<p>The holiday season is a time of joy and family togetherness.  However, one mistake can turn a celebration into a time of tragedy, warns Randy Wright, President of Cottman Transmission and Total Auto Care, a national brand that services virtually any make and model vehicle.  &nbsp;Drinking and driving is one of the major causes of traffic fatalities, and statistics show it spikes during the holiday season.</p><p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reports that 10,076 people were killed in crashes involving a drunk driver in 2013, the latest year for which statistics are available.  In December alone, 733 people died on our roads and highways  23 died on Christmas Day.</p><p>NHTSA is launching its annual Drive Sober of Get Pulled Over campaign, which runs from Dec. 16 through Jan. 1.  As part of the national enforcement campaign, police will increase the number of patrols, set up roadblocks and checkpoints, and use local media to get the message out to all drivers. Drivers caught drinking and driving could face jail time, fines, loss of drivers license, towing fees, and other DUI expenses that total $10,000 on average.</p><p>Its time for all drivers to get the message, said Wright. Drunk driving is a choice you make, and when you make that choice, people get hurt or die.  He said the safest way to get home is to drive sober or catch a ride with a sober designated driver. If you plan to drink at a holiday party or at a restaurant, hand the keys over to someone else  a sober friend  or use a taxi or public transportation.</p><p>NHTSA has a SaferRide mobile app, which allows users to call a taxi or a friend by identifying their location so they can be picked up. The app is available at <a href="http://ow.ly/RWs3S" title="Link: http://ow.ly/RWs3S">http://ow.ly/RWs3S</a> for Android and <a href="http://ow.ly/RWs8h" title="Link: http://ow.ly/RWs8h">http://ow.ly/RWs8h</a> for iPhone users.</p><p>In addition to reminding all drivers to drive sober, NHTSA asks everyone to be alert. If you see a drunk driver on the road, call the police right away. If someone you know is about to drive after drinking, take their keys and help them get home safely.</p><p>NHTSA reminds drivers that even one drink can impair your judgment and increase the risk of getting arrested for driving drunkor worse, the risk of having a crash.</p><p>                            </p><p>All of us at Cottman, including your local Cottman Man, work hard all year long to be sure your car is operating safely and smoothly, Wright said.  We urge our customers, as well as all drivers, to do their part by planning ahead and avoid putting themselves and others in a dangerous or life-threatening position by drinking and driving.  Its a simple choice, driven by common sense.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://www.ucarecdn.com/0cc43d23-4732-43c2-97fa-7a2592f2b38a/" title="Image: http://www.ucarecdn.com/0cc43d23-4732-43c2-97fa-7a2592f2b38a/"><br></p><p><b>About Cottman Transmission and Total Auto Care:</b></p><p>With locations across the U.S., Cottman Transmission and Total Auto Care is a transmission and auto repair brand that services almost any make or model vehicle, foreign or domestic.

<p>Chicago, IL, December 11 - On Dec. 13, nationally renowned family law attorney, and celebrated author, Jeffery M. Leving will appear on WGCI (107.5 FM) at 7 a.m. helping divorced fathers cope during the holidays. He will also discuss the free upcoming <a href="http://www.responsiblefatherhood.com/">Illinois Council on Responsible Fatherhood</a><u>s</u> (ICRF) annual symposium on Dec. 19, which will take place from 11:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the Oak Park Library, 834 Lake Street, Oak Park, IL. Leving is the governor appointed ICRF Chairman and a moderator of the upcoming event.</p><p>Leving has compiled years of research that show the devastating effects of father absence on children. The presence of a father is even more vital around cornerstone events like Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa. The holidays provide opportunities to create memories and traditions to be shared, which is an essential part to maintaining stability and comfort in tumultuous lives that can grow and flourish from a divorced home.</p><p>Home is where the heart is and fathers are a crucial part to building the foundation, said Leving. The ICRF is here to provide a solution to father absence by promoting positive father involvement with their children and contributing resources to support all dads in all communities. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The free ICRF symposium will focus on critical issues facing single and divorced fathers today. The symposiums speakers include social justice leaders as leading matrimonial attorney Maureen A. Gorman and Illinois private detective Wayne Halick, who will both speak on a wide range of fatherhood-related topics focused on keeping children safe during the holidays. Chairman Leving and ICRF council members want to ensure that fathers are provided the essential support and parenting tools to assume the important role they play in their childrens lives.</p><p>Attorney Leving is a leader in the fathers rights movement, attorney and author of the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Good-Divorced-Dad-Break-Up/dp/1118114108"><i>How to Be a Good Divorced Dad</i></a>, which has received praise from President Barack Obama, and was endorsed by Cardinal Francis George of the Archdiocese of Chicago. He has spent his life making significant strides supporting paternal involvement.&nbsp;</p><p>                          </p><p>Leving will also appear Saturday, Dec. 12 at 7 a.m. on WGRB (1390 AM) and Sunday, Dec. 13 at 7:30 a.m. on WVAZ V-103 with Darryl Dennard, continuing the discussion of these important topics. </p>
<p>  </p><p>Ski property specialist Skiingproperty.com has announced its top five resorts for purchasing a ski home in 2016, in a bid to help investors in the French Alps at a time when market conditions are highly favourable to international buyers.<br> <br> Incredibly low interest rates on euro mortgages combined with a weak euro look likely to continue into 2016, said Julian Walker, director at Skiingproperty.com. This is, of course, good news for UK buyers. Meanwhile, infrastructure upgrades in many resorts along with a French Government that is taking measures to stimulate its stagnant property market also indicate that 2016 will be a good time to invest in the French Alps. To help anyone beginning their search for a ski home, here are five resorts we have high hopes for next year.<br> <br> <u>Châtel<br></u><b>Why:</b> Two new ski lifts linking the massifs of Super-Châtel and Linga, providing skiers with easy access to the Portes du Soleil ski area and its 650 kilometres of slopes on a total of 285 pistes, open this season. The upgrade includes a new blue run completing a convenient circular route of the Portes du Soleil.<br> <b>Property:</b> Good choice of new-build, with prices from 150,000 for a studio.<br> <br> <u>Les Menuires<br></u><b>Why: </b>Crowned best family resort at the 2015 World Snow Awards, this is our favourite for anyone buying with family winter holidays in mind. Part of the huge Three Valleys ski area, the resorts children friendliness gets even better this season with the opening of the new Boquetin blue run and two new chair lifts. <br> <b>Property:</b> Ski-in ski-out leaseback apartment from 175,000.</p><p>  </p><p> <u>Les Deux Alpes<br></u><b>Why: </b>Ticking just about every box, from night life to off-piste activities, this resort has just won the best European resort award at the 2015 World Snow Awards. Much excitement this year focuses around the opening of a new blue run, a 10-million investment that completes a 10-kilometre long stretch of entirely blue pistes, starting at 3,600 metres and ending in the resort at 1,600 metres. Re-desiged fun zones also add to its appeal.</p><p>  </p><p><u>La Clusaz<br> </u><b>Why:</b> Chocolate box pretty, not many resorts combine Savoyard tradition with excellent skiing like La Clusaz does. From its weekly street market to the local production of the famous Reblochon cheese, it oozes the type of alpine authenticity suited to couples and families. And being an hours drive from Geneva Airport and just 20 minutes from the rail station at Annecy makes it a realistic weekend destination.<br> <b>Property:</b> 4-star leaseback apartments 142,590.</p><p>  </p><p><u>Val dIsère<br> </u><b>Why:</b> Famous for its lively après-ski and night life, now the skiing at Val dIsère, which is already world-class thanks to it being within the Espace Killy ski area, is set to get even better. August saw the launch of a 16-million, two-year redevelopment of the Solaise area directly above the resort, which will see a brand new mid-mountain station at 2,500 metres. To top off a good year, the resort won two awards at 2015 World Snow Awards - for the best mountain restaurant and best après-ski bar. Exciting times ahead for property-owners there!<br> <b>Property:</b> Luxury apartments near the centre from 900,000.</p><p>  <b>ENDS</b></p><p>  For further information or to enquire about:<br>Julian Walker<br> SkiingProperty.com<br> Tel: +44 20 8150 9502<br> Email: info@skiingproperty.com <br> Website: <a href="http://www.skiingproperty.com/" target="_blank">www.skiingproperty.com</a><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p><p>  </p><p><b><i>About Skiingproperty.com<br> </i></b><i>Skiingproperty.com, which is owned and operated by international property specialist Spot Blue International Property, works with developers in the French and Swiss Alps to promote new and off-plan developments to the UK and wider international market.

<p><i>Poor care and lack of oversight put seniors in jeopardy daily</i></p><p>----------------</p><p>SUMMARY:&nbsp; Senior care expert Nathan J. Mazur is going on record to state that the quality of care provided in Independent Living facilities that offer Assisted Living services is inadequate and potentially dangerous to seniors. A focus needs to be placed on oversight of these typically unlicensed facilities to protect the elderly.</p><div><p><i></i></p>  </div><p>----------------&nbsp;</p><p><i>White Lake, Michigan</i>  I visit at least 20 different care oriented facilities on a monthly basis says Caring Completely Founder and CEO Nathan J. Mazur. More often than not, I see things that are disturbing. Whether it be an odor of urine, medication issues, staff yelling at a resident, or a resident who is struggling to eat but is being ignored, its common for me to see things that would be completely unacceptable to most people in this country. <i></i></p><p>&nbsp;Mazur states that electing a senior care provider is undoubtedly one of the toughest decisions people face today.&nbsp; But knowing who puts the needs of the senior first is a tough thing to figure out when companies all advertise the same high quality of services? Every person that families meet from every care oriented company says the same things. We are compassionate, We are loving, We treat them like they are our own family!, etc. How can that be true for every single company in the marketplace? The answer is, its not true! says Mazur. Unfortunately revenue and sales are typically the main focus of most senior care companies. When Im working with a family and helping them make decisions, I always tell them to focus on the people and places that made them feel comfortable. Everything starts with a relationship, and senior care is no different. But at the end of the day, this is a business, and these are business people doing what they have to do in order to hit numbers. The single biggest perpetrator of putting money over seniors is the Independent Living industry.</p><p>The Independent Living industry is a large aspect of the senior care business. Independent Living technically means that the seniors who reside in those facilities can do most things on their own. Many simply did not want to manage a home on their own any longer. As things in care have evolved, Independent Living facility operators figured out that the trick to long-term, high profits for their buildings was to keep people in their buildings as their health declines. Their belief is that if they can prevent someone from moving out, that is good for the bottom line. Mazur however wonders what is more important; the bottom line, or the seniors themselves? </p><p>Mazur continues, As I said, everyone will tell you that the needs of the seniors come first. Unfortunately, I have personally witnessed over and over that this is not the case in Independent Living. I have worked with families who have been told that their loved one can definitely stay in the Independent Living facility. When I meet with the family and evaluate their loved one, its very obvious within minutes that this person requires 24 hour care, and that its actually dangerous for them to remain there. They may be a fall risk, have dementia, or require assistance with all of their activities of daily living. In Independent Living facilities, the assisted living services are typically provided by a third party in-home care agency. These home care agencies and their staff are simply not qualified to handle a true assisted living resident. Checking on someone every two hours is a terrifying plan for someone who isnt safe by themselves. What if they fall right after a check? They may lay there for two hours until someone discovers that. So what I see all the time is that a family is told that they should purchase one-on-one care, at an hourly rate in order to keep their loved one safe. The cost of this type of service is usually $10,000 or more per month! To have a family do that, when they can move their loved one to a much more qualified facility for half (or less) of the cost is irresponsible, and greedy. In addition, its dangerous! Independent Living facilities are making these decisions based on the financial health of their facility instead of the true health of the senior! Thats just wrong! Its unethical and wrong!</p><p>In an effort to help educate consumers, Mazur has started a new education, advocacy, and placement assistance company called Caring Completely. Caring Completely is a movement of Long-Term Care Professionals working together to change the industry through a network of like-minded providers. Above all else, Mazur and his team believe that people deserve high quality care, and families deserve the ability to be educated about all of the potential options prior to making any decisions about which provider will likely be the best fit for their loved ones needs. If we can help families make decisions that help them sleep more soundly at night, I consider that a win every single time! said Mazur. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Its my goal and my intention to go out of my way to educate families, especially those who have loved ones utilizing assisted living services in Independent Living facilities, about the great, the good, the bad, and the ugly of the senior care industry. These people deserve to know the facts! Mazur continued.</p><p>The danger has only grown as more of these types of Independent Living facilities have opened up, and continue to open up. They are fantastic at providing a great environment for someone who is truly independent, or maybe needs some help being reminded to take their medications. But their ability to do anything above and beyond that in a safe and dignified way is very questionable.</p><p>                                                               </p><p>Nathan J. Mazur is an entrepreneur focused on the senior care industry. He has been featured in CNN Money, AOL/DailyFinance.com, Crains Detroit, and in the Detroit Free Press and The Observer &amp; Eccentric Newspapers. Mazur and his company own and operate multiple assisted living facilities throughout Southeastern Michigan, while also providing private duty in-home care services as well. Through his new company, Caring Completely, he frequently consults directly with families to help them make the best decision for a loved one who is no longer able to care for themselves.

<div>Each year, more than 75 Million people make at least one food donation to one of the millions of a food drives organized in the US.  Unfortunately, the traditional food drive model limits donations to non-perishable food items, typically highly processed canned goods lacking in nutritional quality. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As such, there is a disconnect between what food drives produce and what's actually needed.  I know I'm preaching to the choir, but the rates of diet related health conditions (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, etc.) among the food insecure population are staggering.  The idea of donating a canned good laden with sodium and sugar to people with these health issues is obviously nonsensical.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="line-height: 18.1818px;">It's great that so many people want to help.  It's unfortunate that they are donating the wrong stuff, which is why we developed our Crowd-feeding platform - an online food drive system that enables people to donate fresh fruits, vegetables and other healthy foods instead of the usual stuff.  Our system ensures that the good intentions actual have when they donate food have a positive impact.  We've reinvented the food drive model to turn the billions of canned goods donated each year into healthy, impactful food. &nbsp;</span><br></div>

A womans role in business has evolved considerably over the past century. As the era of the housewife dissolved and women entered the business world by storm, many have since experienced a struggle to break through the corporate glass ceiling. Discrimination, pre-existing attitudes and the constant competition made the glass ceiling a controversial topic that was often swept under the rug.<div><p>Skip forward to present day, where women are truly shining in the business world. With more Owners, Founders and C level women business leaders than ever, the cannabis industry has not been neglected from the integration. As the industry forms at an alarming rate, so have the opportunities for driven and intelligent women to make a positive impact while rising to the top.</p><p>Within the legal cannabis industry, there is a diverse, broad cross-section of business opportunities that include not only internal segments such as dispensaries, cultivators, and labs, but also numerous ancillary businesses, including outsourced human resources, legal services, marketing and public relations, to name just a few.</p><p>Many of the voices supporting the cannabis industry are long-time advocates who have been driven by their passion for their civil rights and the overhanging health issues in our global community. Women have been a strong force at the forefront of this movement and are propelling the legal cannabis business at such a rapid pace, that there is no doubt that the cannabis industry could very well become the first female dominated multi-billion dollar global industry.</p><p>Recently, I had the opportunity to speak with several female thought leaders in the industry to gain their valuable insights and perspectives on how women truly are emerging as a dominant force and how other entrepreneurs can capitalize on this industry.</p><h4>Theres No Glass Ceiling in Legal Cannabis</h4><p>Case in point,&nbsp;<a href="https://angel.co/giadhaadc" target="_blank">Giadha DeCarcer</a>, an Ivy League-educated serial entrepreneur who obtained her undergraduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania and a masters degree from Georgetown University, has 20 years experience in management, business execution, strategic business development, and has long focused on emerging markets. DeCarcer, a legal cannabis entrepreneurial powerhouse in her own right, identified a void in the legal cannabis industrythe lack of reliable and actionable dataand built&nbsp;<a href="http://www.frontierfinancials.com/" target="_blank">New Frontier Financial</a>&nbsp;into one of the leading big data research and technology companies in the industry.</p><p>Given that women have been in many male-dominated industries struggling to be heard or to make as much of an impact as we may have desired, we have had much more of an incentive to enter a high-risk space such as the cannabis industry early on, opines Giadha DeCarcer, the founder and Chief Executive Officer of New Frontier Financial.</p><blockquote><p>I believe that this greater appetite to take a chance stems from our own risk-reward equation  we have less to lose and much more to win. As such, we have entered the industry guns blazing, educated, hungry and excited to finally have a clear path forward, with no glass ceiling, no ceiling period.</p></blockquote><p>According to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/03/06/womens-college-enrollment-gains-leave-men-behind/" target="_blank">Pew Research</a>, statistics show that women are graduating from college and receiving masters degrees in greater numbers than men. Likewise, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sba.gov/" target="_blank" title="Link: https://www.sba.gov/">Small Business Administration</a>&nbsp;reports that in part, because ten to twenty years ago, many women left their careers to raise a family are also now re-entering the workforce, the growth of new businesses created by women is increasing faster than that of men.</p><h4>Advice for Aspiring Female Entrepreneurs</h4><p><a href="http://jazminhupp.com/" target="_blank">Jazmin Hupp</a>, co-founder and executive director of&nbsp;<a href="http://womengrow.com/" target="_blank">Women Grow</a>, an organization founded to connect, educate, and empower women in the cannabis industry, offers advice to women considering a career or launching a business in the legal cannabis industry:</p><blockquote><p>We have a lot of amazing women in this industry. If youre thinking about yourself personally, the first step is just to examine your own skill set. See what youre really fabulous at. If you come from a marketing background, then looking at doing marketing in the cannabis industry is going to be a great first step.</p></blockquote><p>Hupp continues, If you dont have professional expertise that lends itself to serving other businesses or serving the cannabis industry, then the first stop, honestly, is probably going to be getting a job with an existing cannabis company. Thats why a lot of folks come to our monthly events, to meet people in the cannabis community and get an understanding of which types of companies they might want to work for.</p><p><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/news/profiles-strategies/2014/06/what-a-21-year-old-venture-capitalist-can-teach.html" target="_blank">Yoela Palkin</a>, another female entrepreneur and co-founder of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wherefour.com/">Wherefour, Inc.</a>, an innovative Silicon Valley-based cash-management and analytics startup catering to dispensaries observes, As a female whos grown up in the tech industry, Im used to seeking out sectors with challenges that can be solved through new product development. Theres a huge opportunity [for women] to dive in and be one of the first innovators, but it also takes a strong work ethic and a deep understanding of your customers real issues.</p><h4>Final Words of Advice</h4><p>While the legal cannabis industry has matured significantly over the years, medical and adult use is still illegal under federal law. Likewise, because laws and regulatory frameworks differ significantly from state to state, there still is somewhat of a wild west element to the industry. Consequently, authorities in the industry believe it imperative that aspiring entrepreneurs take their respective roles seriously and deliberately. According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reneeharrison" target="_blank" title="Link: https://www.linkedin.com/in/reneeharrison">Renee Harrison</a>, Founder and CEO of&nbsp;<a href="http://mogulymedia.com/" target="_blank">Moguly Media</a>:</p><blockquote><p>For women who are new to the industry or established, I suggest they commit to learning as much as they can about the industry and keep up with the landscape as it continually involves. You cant know everything, so define your niche and dont ever stop learning.</p></blockquote><p>Harrison further advises, Take continuing education classes, attend conferences, and network through organizations such as Women Grow. Then contribute to the industry and your peers; share your knowledge with the world by mentoring others, contributing to publications, volunteering to be a guest on podcasts, and even consider writing a book. Not only will you be making a positive contribution to the legitimacy of the industry, but you will build your personal brand and business in the process.</p></div>

  <p>Collage studies may be continued through taking out loans, even if student will not have a clean history of creating payments before. The truth is that poor credit student loans are a lot easier to avail as compared to other people who have damaged payment history. However, the loan needs to be availed just after evaluating your situation nicely.</p>    <p>First simpler source which you need to search is National loans, which don't need at all the student's poor credit or no credit as an issue. Acceptance of the national loans comes without enquiries about your previous history of payments. Such loans get as Stafford and Perkins loans in subsidized or unsubsidized forms. Furthermore, the student does not have any weight of repayment as it may be produced just after completing the collage studies. Plus loans also are readily available for such borrowers to empower their parent to borrow the loan on behalf of the son or daughter.</p>    <p>However, the issue with national loans is that just those students are eligible who have a successful economic history. Therefore, in case your parents bring in nicely and possess an excellent financial position, you've got little choice than to choose poor credit student loans from private lenders. They are able to provide you with a personal loan in secured or unsecured choice.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>But as you do not have a valued property of your own, you are going to borrow the private loans together with assistance from your parents. They're going to take the loan for you personally. The guaranteed loan is of low interest rate on greater borrowed sum ranging from 5000 to 75000, plus it may be paid back in 5 to 30 years. The unsecured loan is of higher rate of interest, with just smaller number of 3000 to 25000 approved for its repayment in 5 to ten years.</p>    <p>It is best to choose poor credit student loans using a cosigner that has an excellent credit history. This type of cosigner empowers in borrowing the cash at low interest rate.

Ssemakula Peter Luyima studied various world economy/political economy theories and concepts, and now introduces his own theory called MuRatopian Intersection Economy that could salvage the current world economy.</p><p>Ideas have power. Thought precedes action. Changing the economic policies and behaviors that are generating high levels of poverty, widening inequality and bankrupting Nature is not possible without first changing the erroneous economic concepts and theories on which the world economy is currently functioning. A Change in thinking can lead to new foundations of economics. This is the rationale for the new book on New Economic Theory (MuRatopian Intersection Economics) a revised concept initiated by Professor Karou Yamaguchi integrated with Kelsonian two factor market economics and new structural laws of supply and demand to provide the correct formal foundations of theoretical economics. MuRatopian structural axiom set is new in theoretical economics and replaces conventional approaches.<br></p><p>Regarding his new book Ssemakula stated <i>There is an urgent need today to understand why old theories were created, where and why they fail now and then propose a feasible, more efficient alternative. This is the rationale and justification for a re-evaluation of the fundamental concepts and premises of traditional economic theory with the goal of developing a new theory to achieve equitable economic development of the continents of the Earth</i>.<br></p><p>The objective is to harness both public money system and binary market reform with structural axiomatic economics approach to have a new theory of how an equitable world economy works. MuRatopian Intersection Economics is about how an equitable world economy works and practices to create a coherent and comprehensive monetary and unified structurial market system framework for equitable-approach, sustainable world economy and one that incorporates Creativity Machine Paradigm, advocates for democratic capital acquisition with earnings of income to poor and middle class people and to provide compelling educational and communication tools with the power to challenge conventional wisdom and alter university level education, public policy, business decisions, media coverage and general public opinion regarding how the world economy should and can work for the betterment of all humanity.<br></p><p><b>About Ssemakula Peter Luyima</b><br></p><p>Ssemakula Peter Luyima provides a new concept for World Economy in the 21st century, by producing a revised concept of MuRatopian Economy; 30 years after Professor Kaoru Yamaguchi presented a synthesized analysis of the Neoclassical, Keynesian and Marxian with his own public money economic model.<br></p><p>It is this authors intention not only to provide an integrative concept for reconstruction of the World Economy, but to present an equitable economic strategy in the context of Louis Orth Kelsos important two factor economics at the same time.

<p><b><u>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</u></b></p><p><b>New Book for a New Economic Theory Features Alternative Monetary and Reform Market System from Traditional Economic Model!</b></p><p><b>MASERU, LESOTHO-December 25th, 2015</b><br></p><p><b><img alt="" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/robin8-production/robin8-production/8d3e4906-9bf1-4c53-b91a-0b6acbaff3b5/CoverArt.jpg" title="Image httpwwwucarecdncom8d3e4906-9bf1-4c53-b91a-0b6acbaff3b5"><br></b></p><p>Efforts to reform current debt economic system and market system are invariably opposed by both an intellectual orthodoxy and vested economic interests. They draw on the traditional economic system of prevailing macroeconomic theory to support prevailing policies. They argue that given the laws of economy and current circumstances, we are living in the best possible world. This is simply not true. The multidimensional challenges confronting humanity today are human-made and can be changed by a change in thought and action. Theoretical limitations and one factor free market system are a primary root cause of persistent poverty, rapid and rising levels of unemployment, inequality, and calamitous environmental threats. That concern is investigated by <i>The New Future of Money</i> (FeedARead Publishing Press <a href="http://www.feedaread.com/books/The-New-Future-of-Money.aspx">http://www.feedaread.com/books/The-New-Future-of-Money.aspx</a>, which demonstrates that poor and middle class people can leverage both <i>public money system </i>for debt free economies<i> </i>and <i>Kelsonian binary model</i> that places great importance on  democratizing the process of democratic capital acquisition as a means of promoting widespread prosperity and economic justice for all people other than Full employment alone, while reducing or eliminating their vulnerability to macroeconomic model. </p><p>Ssemakula Peter Luyima, the author, is an independent researcher (<a href="http://www.muratopianeconomy.tk/">http://www.muratopianeconomy.tk/</a>) formerly with Science and Engineering Research Centre Nairobi Kenya, whose scientific research background-under different mentorship guidance of Kenyan Professor Madara Ogot and recently with Japanese Professor Kaoru Yamaguchi, Binary Economist Professor Robert Ashford advocating the legacy of Louis Orth Kelso, Germany Professor Egmont Kakarot and Dr Stephen Thaler pioneering Creativity Machine Paradigm-enabled him to identify the new MuRatopian Intersection Economics he describes. While most of the concepts arent usually thought of as important to form a new economic foundation, intersection of all the mentioned concepts is a key qualification for success in building a uniform world equitable economic foundation.</p><p>For example:</p><p></p><ul><li>Public Money Administration best practices in monetary system design would be a strong asset in monetary stability and financial stability.<br></li><li>Kelsonian binary model could become a Creativity Machine Paradigm partner for ownership broadening system of corporate finance, principal of objectivity of binary financing principles that demonstrate both labor and capital do work, and detailing the principles of a broader distribution of capital acquisition with the earnings of capital, binary economic growth, of sustainability function and requires no government distribution, borrowing, command, or other market intervention.<br></li><li>MuRatopian Intersection Economics analysis explains a new paradigm of how markets should function. When do market institutions fail? How do they behave when they fail? How markets should be designed to minimize failure, and what tradeoffs with market efficiency arise in doing so?<br></li><li>The new economy investigation begins analyzing some specific aspects of the current debt economic system and implementation need of the new integrated concepts of public money system, Kelsonian binary model, Creativity Machine Paradigm with new structural laws of demand and supply.<br></li></ul><p></p><p>Global readers may be motivated to become MuRatopian economists, or advocates specializing in MuRatopian Intersection Economics. Many of the multidisciplinary fields can be springboards for consulting practices-or new revenue streams for established consultancies.</p><p>As Ssemakula describes each concept in MuRatopian Intersection Economics, readers will:</p><p></p><ul><li>Understand why public money system can be a significant advantage to World Economy<br></li><li>Be able to imagine themselves in the new economy reading about how the typical equitable world economy works<br></li><li>Understand how the future objective free market economy that can allow the broad distribution of capital acquisition and income to working class and poor people around the world<br></li><li>Learn how Creativity Machine Paradigm is affecting employment, as well as what the future world brain will likely be<br></li></ul><p></p><p>Readers will learn how public money system communities tailored with how labor can broadly benefit as capital owners related to production and consumption: the entire living population of nations around the world, as well as future generations, within the future time horizon considered.</p><p>While there are many books describing economic inequalities, Ssemakulas gives new- and much broader- meaning to the term <i>MuRatopian Intersection Economics</i>, demonstrating that an equitable world economy constitutes precious new economic theory in a world dependent on globalization.</p><p><b>CONTACT</b>:</p><p>Ssemakula Peter Luyima</p><p>26657754830</p><p><a href="mailto:muratopianeconomy@gmail.com">muratopianeconomy@gmail.com</a> </p><p><b>About Ssemakula Peter Luyima</b><br></p><p>Ssemakula Peter Luyima provides a new concept for World Economy in the 21st century, by producing a revised concept of MuRatopian Economy; 30 years after Professor Kaoru Yamaguchi presented a synthesized analysis of the Neoclassical, Keynesian and Marxian with his own public money economic model.<br></p><p>It is this authors intention not only to provide an integrative concept for reconstruction of the World Economy, but to present an equitable economic strategy in the context of Louis Orth Kelsos important two factor economics at the same time.

<p><b>Vaccination, early detection and treatment play key role in controlling influenza epidemic</b></p><p>PLANO, TX (Dec. 21, 2015) Cold and flu (commonly referred to as the influenza) season are officially here, peaking in the U.S. between December and February. If you havent had a flu vaccination yet, its not too late to get one. But if you did get vaccinated, it doesnt guarantee you wont get the flu, notes Co-Founder and Chief Medical Officer Jay Woody, M.D., of <a href="http://www.legacyer.com/">Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care</a>, one of the nations first hybrid health care models offering both urgent care and emergency room treatment options under one roof.</p><p>Even if youve had the flu vaccine this season, its possible to become ill with a strain of flu that isnt covered, Woody explains. But that shouldnt stop one from trying to protect themselves every year. The majority of people who get flu shots wont get the flu that season.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the flu vaccine annually for everyone six months and older. But thats just the first step. Take preventative steps such as staying away from people who are ill and washing your hands regularly. Touching doorknobs, faucet handles and other everyday objects we come in contact with, as well as shaking hands or eating and drinking after someone, are common ways to spread germs. Dont go to work if youre ill or send your children to school or day care.</p><p>Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care still has the flu vaccine available and physicians are on staff to treat you if you become ill. People at high risk, especially, should seek treatment  children younger than two years, adults 65 and older, pregnant women and people with certain medical conditions. Influenza antiviral drugs are prescribed.</p><p>At other urgent care facilities, patients typically have a 2 to 3 hour wait time until they can see a doctor, even with call ahead scheduling. At Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care, the average wait time is less than eight minutes, with most patients being seen, treated and released in less than one hour. This is particularly helpful when time is scarce for scheduling an appointment with your regular physician or youre trying to get the flu vaccine.</p><p>How do you know whether you have a cold or the flu? The onset of symptoms is the first clue. A cold comes on gradually, while the flu hits quickly. Fever  typically lasting 3-4 days, aches and chills are the primary symptoms of the flu, whereas a cold is marked by sneezing, stuffy nose and sore throat. You may experience chest discomfort and a cough with both, in varying severity. A headache and fatigue or weakness are common with the flu but rare with a cold.</p><p>At Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care, were here when you need us, Woody said. Illness doesnt strike when its convenient, during a doctors office hours. We have board certified medical doctors on staff around the clock. There is no need to put off getting the flu vaccine.</p><p>Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Cares hybrid model (both a free standing emergency room and urgent care center), allows patients to only pay for the care they need. Billing is always based on whether a condition was an urgent care visit (more than 70 percent fall into this category) or an emergency. Patients wont be billed for an emergency, no matter what time of day, unless they actually receive emergency care.</p><p>Urgent care hours are from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily, and emergency room services are accessible 24/7, 365 days a year. Online check-in is available and walk-ins are welcomed.</p><p><b>About Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care:</b> Founded in 2008, Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care is one of the nations first stand-alone health care models to offer both urgent care and emergency room treatment options under one roof. It has built an exceptional customer service program and rating by providing transparent billing, soothing environments and one-on-one service with board-certified, emergency-trained physicians. Patients have access to immediate, on-site emergency room equipment and only pay emergency care prices when it is truly an emergency.

<p><b>More Than 270 Children across Texas Receive Holiday Gifts</b></p><p>DALLAS, TEXAS (Dec. 22, 2015)Christmas is just around the corner, but for 97 families across the state, the holiday cheer arrived much earlier this year. <a href="http://www.heroesforchildren.org/Default.aspx">Heroes for Children</a> (HFC)  a unique nonprofit that provides social and financial assistance to families whose children are battling cancer  hosted Holiday Heroes celebrations in Austin, Dallas, Houston and Fort Worth, providing an evening of holiday cheer for families facing a cancer diagnosis.</p><p>A cancer diagnosis can cause a strain on any familys income, which makes purchasing gifts for the holidays really difficult, says Larissa Linton, cofounder and executive director of Heroes for Children. To alleviate the financial burden and provide a sense of normalcy, each year we host Holiday Heroes to allow families to celebrate the season, despite their childs cancer diagnosis.<br></p><p>This year more than 97 families  which included 272 children from Austin, Dallas, Houston and Fort Worth  participated in Holiday Heroes celebrations, the most families served since the program began. For the first time ever the program was brought to Austin to serve children who are being treated at Dell Childrens Hospital. This is also the first year that the program was solely funded by the support of local businesses, organizations and families  including UnitedHealthcare, McKesson, Bank of America in Dallas, Riveron Consulting in Houston, and Keller Williams South in Austin.</p><p>Holiday Heroes offers full holiday joy to the families, which it serves throughout the year. Each holiday season, social workers choose families in need from hospitals across the state of Texas served by Heroes for Children. Families selected for the program are adopted and benefit from individual, corporate and community sponsors. These sponsors can contribute pure financial support, or they can get more involved on a personal level. Sponsors that choose to be more involved will go out into the community and shop, wrap and donate gifts to HFC families.

<p>Joseph DAntonis new spy thriller thrusts readers into a bold espionage journey to stop an Argentine mobster from completing his horrific biological experiments to weaponize children. The adventure begins when Wades handler and lover Megan Winslow disappears only to be found deep undercover as a lab technician in a mob controlled medical facility where orphan children are being injected to become the mobsters instruments of destructions. Facing the overwhelming odds of a well-armed private army, Wade Hanna has little time to apply his unique skills as a black ops specialist to save Megan and the children. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While the science fiction genre has long been a staple of the literary world, readers and critics alike often cry out for narratives based on true science that dont succumb to unreal assumptions and grandiose imagination. Thankfully, Joseph DAntoni applies his forty-five years of experience as a forensic expert and extensive researcher to bring us this market gripping fourth novel in his covert intelligent series. </p><p>Shadow Cell is a fiction book based in the 1980s on real medical experiments previously conducted by the Nazis during WWII. It takes us on a journey of what those experiments might have produced with todays technology. The author makes the believable account of what would happen if such secret research found its way to unscrupulous world powers unfriendly to America. </p><p>Synopsis:</p><p>Based on the evidence, Wade Hanna had reason to believe Megan was dead. With dogged determination and tracking skills learned in his Louisiana swamp Wade discovers Megan is not dead but on her own dangerous undercover mission for Army intelligence. Her medical training which made her cover story believable to the terrorist has now become life threatening. She faces likely discovery and torture if she doesnt apply her biomedical talents to the will of her mobster boss. </p><p>Wades single focus to save her soon becomes a suicide mission as Megan faces choices between the childrens lives and her own. Even with the help of Wades black ops European mentor Leopold, Wade has to cleverly think through every small step of his own survival to rescue her. He relies mostly on instincts to disguise himself among the friendly people he so desperately needs to help.</p><p>Shadow Cell is not a story about a sleeper terrorist cell waiting to come alive within our shores. Its about real cells in our body and how through technology they can and may in the future be manipulated. Children are particularly vulnerable in this story because they were exploited for their cell generating capacity as well as being ideal targets against weaknesses and loopholes in Americas adoption and immigration system.</p><p>If there is a secondary message for readers of Shadow Cell it is to urge them to become more vigilant. Question, understand and close weaknesses in our borders, internet and electronic systems we depend on and hold dear to our way of life but can be exploited by our enemies.</p><p>DAntoni will soon start working on the fifth novel in this series which is scheduled for release in 2016. Shadow Cell is available now on Amazon. You can follow the author on social media through his website. He has appeared on numerous syndicated shows and is available for interviews </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>About the Author:</p><p>Joseph DAntoni was born in Louisiana and went to school in both Louisiana and California where he obtained advanced degrees including his doctorate from the University of Southern California.

The concept of world domination used to be relegated to science fiction movies however Amazon may yet become one of the first to make it a reality.<br><br>Their recent addition of the Streaming Partners program could be the start of Amazon as the worlds first global OTT (over the top) programming provider.<br><br>With 83.5% of Facebook users and 79% of Twitter users coming from outside the US, companies today must be globally focused to truly compete and grow.<br><br>Comcast business is limited to the US.&nbsp; With cable systems passing about 44% of all US homes and 22 million subscribers it has a strong presence but only in the US.<br><br>Amazon is a global company; According to Mark Mahaney, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, 37% of its 80 million Prime subscribers are from outside the US and is growing quickly.<br><br>Amazons foray into OTT is the precursor to the separation of the programming platform from the wired cable.&nbsp; I believe that sometime in the next 3 to 5 years most cable companies will sell broadband access only and the program offerings will be spun off into separate companies which will have lots of competition from OTT providers like Amazon. &nbsp;Much like what happened with the separation of local and long distance telephone service.<br><br>The acquisition of Comcast would thrust Amazon into becoming a leading OTT service with a major share of the new on demand marketplace as well as the existing cable net universe.<br><br>With Comcast Amazon would obtain major US direct to home distribution, a major movie studio, 16 major cable nets, including Bravo, USA Network, E Entertainment, CNBC, MSNBC, Golf Channel, Syfy and more as well as acquire the management and capabilities of a programming powerhouse with NBC.<br><br>The other businesses of Comcast such as the Universal Studios theme parks could be a great place to promote all of Amazons products and businesses.&nbsp; The Comcast Spectacor and Ventures segments could be kept or spun off.<br><br>With the recent announcement of the expansion of its Prime Video service with the addition of the Streaming Partners program Amazon is quickly becoming like a new type of cable operator as they will offer cable nets, on demand and a la carte pay tv.<br><br>This is one of the first non-related party deals where major cable nets will be sold by an OTT provider. Amazon will be selling its Prime customers Showtime, Starz, A+E Network, AMC, Ring TV Boxing and others.&nbsp; Showtime and Starz will each sell for only $8.99 per month (less than on most cable systems).&nbsp; The other services will be priced accordingly.<br><br>Until streaming media cable operators totally controlled what you could watch in your home.&nbsp; They had such a strong hold on the distribution that, as far back as the 1980s the program services began selling the operators equity stakes to assure distribution.&nbsp; Most recently the BBC sold 50% of their US TV network to AMC to substantially improve their ability to obtain cable access and receive favorable affiliate fees.<br><br>You may recall the dispute Comcast had with Netflix a few years ago which was resolved by Netflix paying Comcast a fee to assure that Netflix customers would have access to quality streaming pictures.&nbsp; While a major premise of Net Neutrality is to eliminate the chance that cable operators could pick and choose what subscribers can access from the internet, it is uncertain as to whether it will become law.<br><br>In order to guarantee distribution of a product many companies choose to control the entire distribution from factory to consumer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Retailers like Coach own stores to assure control over their distribution and sales.<br><br>The only way Amazon can guarantee the ability to distribute its video programming direct to consumers, without the possibility of cable operator control and compensation, is to own the cable operator.<br><br>In addition to obtaining direct broadband access to consumers, Amazon would obtain all the behavior information of its users and all the agreements with the program providers. The cable consumer behavior database for 18% of US households would be valuable to increasing the sales for the retailing side of Amazon.<br><br>As the largest cable operator Comcast most likely has the best rates and terms for the cable programming networks.&nbsp; In addition Comcast most likely has most favored nations clauses in their agreements.&nbsp; MFNs guarantee that if a programmer gives a better deal to another cable company then Comcast has to get the same deal.<br><br>Owning the largest cable operator would also provide substantial leverage for Amazon to extract beneficial terms from the program networks to expand Amazons OTT platform globally as well as for their wired customer offerings.<br><br>Owning some of the top cable networks and a major movie studio would enable Amazon to become the dominant force in on demand subscription based programming as well as to become a formidable competitor to Netflix, the current dominant player.<br><br>As a global company Amazon has a worldwide customer base and relationships in many countries.&nbsp; 30 million of Amazons Prime customers are outside the US.&nbsp; &nbsp;Digital subscriptions can be sold worldwide provided the seller owns the rights.&nbsp; Owning a movie studio and many major cable networks could help with the rights issues and adding all of Comcasts owned cable networks into the OTT offering could provide a formidable package to market worldwide.<br><br>The ability to grow Comcasts TV business globally is substantial for Amazon.&nbsp; Bottom line is Amazon can afford to pay a lot more for Comcast than most others.<br><br>Comcast has 23 million customers and passes 54 million homes (potential customers).&nbsp; 54 million homes represents 44% of all homes in the US.&nbsp;&nbsp; While we do not know how many of those homes already buy from Amazon surely there are lots that do not.<br><br>But even better is the golden handcuffs deals Amazon could offer existing Prime subscribers to add Comcast broadband.&nbsp; This could be a higher level of Prime.&nbsp; In any case the ability to bundle and package broadband access with the buying of products could create advantage for Amazon in competitive market.&nbsp; Watch out Walmart.<br><br>Now is the time for Amazon to buy Comcast as they are still effectively a minor player in video.&nbsp; An acquisition of Comcast would most likely not be challenged by the FTC or the Justice Department.<br><br>A simple stock merger could be a goldmine for Comcast shareholders.&nbsp; As for Amazon shareholders they would benefit from becoming the market leader in the future of television globally.<br><br>Amazon stock has grown over 355% in the last almost 4 years. Compare that to Comcasts 252% growth.&nbsp; Trading Comcast for Amazon could put lots more value in Comcast shareholders pockets sooner.<br><br>Amazon has traditionally been a builder and not a buyer.&nbsp; However at some point they may realize that its more profitable to acquire success then to build it from the ground up. Further it would be almost impossible to build an entertainment asset base that Comcast has from scratch.&nbsp; Further the new OTT, on demand, market is changing and growing quickly and it would take far too long to even create a fraction of Comcasts assets even if Amazon only focused on the video portion.<br><br>Im not an investment banker so I wont get into the financial deal strategies.&nbsp; However I will note that Amazon, in addition to all the strategic benefits cited in this article, could truly benefit from adding Comcasts $17 Billion cash flow.&nbsp; As for the deal structure Ill leave that to the experts.<br><br>The acquisition of Comcast by Amazon would bring Amazon a whole host of benefits from a very strong entertainment powerhouse, many cable nets thereby creating a very robust OTT offering, vertical integration for the OTT service, $17 billion in cash flow and much more.&nbsp; Also at this stage there should not be antitrust issues. Wait too long and the deal could be stopped.<br><br>@jeffbezos what are you waiting for?

<p>First of all, we have steel. Steel is the oldest material used for bike frames. Lately, this material has known an immense technological progress, the density not being as high as it used to be. Thus, the frame also weighs less than before. The bike frames made from steel are a bit more difficult to manufacture than the ones made from aluminium, which also makes them more expensive. These frames are well-known for their shock resistance as well as for their weight resistance. The joints are also more resistant than with the aluminium frames. The joints are one of the specific features of these bike frames, the pipes also being thinner than with the aluminium ones.</p><p>The steel frames are the heaviest of all the bike frames on the market and there are very high chances that they get rusty if they are not properly treated. For instance, they get rusty if you leave them out in the rain, if you drop paint on them and so on. They can be hit, the worst case scenario being that they bend a little. These frames are also less rigid than the aluminium ones and they also protect the rider's back better than these ones.</p><p><a href="http://www.hulkbike.com/carbon-rims-c-41/">carbon mtb rim</a></p><p><a href="http://www.hulkbike.com/carbon-rims-c-41/">carbon bicycle rim</a></p><p>        </p><p><a href="http://www.hulkbike.com/carbon-rims-c-41/">carbon mountain bike rim</a></p>

<p>Nearly 90 percent of Americans who make New Years resolutions will fail. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/01/07/its-january-7-and-a-quarter-of-us-have-already-abandoned-our-new-years-resolutions/" title="Link: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/01/07/its-january-7-and-a-quarter-of-us-have-already-abandoned-our-new-years-resolutions/">Washington Post</a>) As a leader in womens health and wellness, <a title="Link: null">Solis Mammography</a> took a look at five of the biggest New Years resolution fails, with suggestions for ways to overcome bars set a bit too high.</p><p>For example, weight loss tops out the list. The problem is that, like men, women pledge dramatic changes instead of gradual habits that will stick. For instance, someone will fail with a month-long juice fast, where they might succeed if they cut back on dessert.<br></p><p>Health and wellness resolutions are really about making important changes that affect your physical, mental and social well-being, says Connie Oliver, vice president of marketing and client relations for Solis Mammography. Its not so much about shedding the muffin top, as it is cutting back on the muffins for breakfast and deciding oatmeal will fuel your day better. Its about making long-term adjustments to how we live, so we can get more out of life.</p><p>But people tend to set unreasonable goals and make absolute statements to motivate themselves, which has the opposite affect when you, say, break open a bag of chips when your resolution was NO CHIPS (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/31/new-years-resolutions_n_6396324.html">Huffington Post</a>). Here are five epic health and wellness resolution fails, and how you can stick to your resolutions:<br></p><p><b>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; </b><b>Fitting into your skinny jeans.</b> According to <a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/">statisicbrain.com</a>, 38 percent of all New Years resolutions focus on weight loss. Unfortunately, women tend to unrealistically restrict themselves, quickly falling off the horse.<br></p><p>Instead, make healthier food choices; substitute water for soda, and start using a calorie counting program like Weight Watchers or My Fitness Pal to better understand the calories you are actually consuming. Many women underestimate the calories they put in their mouths.<br></p><p><b>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; </b><b>Run a half-marathon. </b>Fitness goals are good, but unless youve successfully run a 10K, focusing on a half-marathon probably isnt the best place to start.<br></p><p>Instead, work up to exercise. The <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/features/healthynewyear/">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) recommends activity for at least 2.5 hours a week. Many women think gym, but starting with a walk outdoors is usually a good first step. Recruit a buddy who will hold you accountable. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. And make sure you talk to your doctor before starting anything strenuous.&nbsp;</p><p><b>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; </b><b>Conquering your to-do list by sacrificing sleep. </b>Many women try to accomplish more with late nights and early mornings. But insufficient sleep is associated with a number of chronic diseases and conditions (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/features/sleep/index.html">CDC</a>).</p><p>Instead, remove TVs and gadgets from your bedroom, create a quiet relaxing environment, and try to schedule your sleep. Adults need 7-8 hours. And remember  sleep is a necessity, not a luxury.<br></p><p><b>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; </b><b>Stop drinking. </b>For some, the need to stop drinking is life or death. Others realize they overindulge and decide to quit cold turkey. Youll need to inventory your lifestyle, and talk to your doctor to decide which category youre in. Studies show that if you can consistently drink two drinks without needing anymore alcohol, you are in a safe zone. But if two drinks consistently trigger the need for more, you might have a problem.<br></p><p>Instead of going it alone, if you fall into the latter category, get help. Alcohol is a real addiction, and a resolution to abruptly stop isnt going to work. There are a lot of organizations to help.<br></p><p><b>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; </b><b>An apple a day keeps the doctor away</b>.<b> </b>Only go to the doctor when you spike a fever? No news is good news, right? Wrong!<br></p><p>Instead, keeping up with regular doctor visits and tests can help you live longer and healthier (<a href="http://www.webmd.com/women/features/health-resolutions-for-women?page=5">WebMD</a>). For example, twice a year dental visits, annual pap smears, vaccines, blood pressure, mammograms starting at 40 and colonoscopies starting at 50 are examples of things you should schedule regularly.<br></p><p>Screenings are important for early detection, so if an issue is discovered, treatment is easier, says Oliver. And with technology constantly advancing, many screenings are much more accurate and sometimes easier than they used to be. For example, 2D mammograms are the standard, but newer 3D mammograms  also known as tomosynthesis  take a much more detailed view of the breast and have been shown to significantly reduce the number of false positives and recalls for additional testing.<br></p><p><b>About Solis Mammography</b><br></p><p>Solis Mammography is a specialized health care provider focused exclusively on providing women an exceptional mammography experience. Headquartered in Addison, Texas, Solis currently operates centers across four states  Texas, Arizona, Ohio and North Carolina.

The new animated Christmas music video, Picking Up Santa Claus, answers this challenging question, musically, and makes it sound like child's play! Hear it, in the sweetest of tones, straight from the mouth of babes: 8-year-old singing, twin reindeer sisters? There is something very human about this pair of reindeer, and their singing friends as well. They have the warmest voices. They happen to be my daughters, but everyone seems to agree. I can't sing -- but they surely can!<br> <br> The vocalists include 8-year-old twin sisters, Amy and Nicole Salerno, who have been singing for "many years". When they were in China, at four-and-a-half, the Chinese TV station followed them around trying to get them to perform in their Beijing TV Children's holiday specials. Now, accompanied by Fifth Dimension singer, Leonard Tucker, and without trying to sound even a little bit like an adult, Amy and Nicole make this original Christmas song takes flight. And flight is the keyword here, specially every Christmas Eve, when reindeer suddenly, and mysteriously start to fly!<br> <br> So if you, or yours, have been perplexed for some time contemplating and trying to unravel the mysteries of Santa and his flying reindeer, head over to Youtube.com and watch the new Christmas music video Picking Up Santa Claus <a href="https://youtu.be/7DlJQRgvn9I">https://youtu.be/7DlJQRgvn9I</a>  and have a bunch of cute reindeer, a snowman and a monster or two, sing you some nice sounding answers!<br> <br> JS Enterprises creates animated and interactive presentations and educational material, these days, mostly for children.</p>  <p># # #</p>      <br>
<p><i>The worlds leading millionaire dating app cuts to the good-looking chase with a global meet and greet. Stellar city hopping through NYC, LA, London and Brazil, the luxury app will put the opulent 1% center stage, starting in the Big Apple. </i></p><p><b></b><br></p><p>Known for its audacity and ruthless vetting process, Millionaire Dating app Luxy is holding its first singles nights. To be held in New York, LA, London and Brazil, this exclusive event will be giving elite singles the most glamorous evening of 2016. But so what? Singles nights are happening all the time all over town. Thats true, but not like this.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Despite dates not being revealed yet, Luxy will be flying their extra special guests in on private helicopters. Although a fairly new Silicon Valley startup, Luxy has its own access to luxury choppers, giving their high flying users a VIP entrance to match their VIP membership.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>From the very beginning, Luxy has promised nothing but high quality - from user experience to user profiles - they dont just let anyone on the app, and Luxy does not intend to let its standards slip at the events either.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>At the party where being single doesn't guarantee you an invitation, just like the apps vetting process Luxy will only allow attractive people into their party and wont apologise for turning people away. And if the singles are not attractive, theyll need their tax return form to prove that they earn north of $200k.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The party is not solely for Luxy users. So if youre not attractive and you cant prove that youre on $200k minimum, youre not getting in. There is no point, no one will speak to you, says Luxy spokesman, going by the name of Andrew M, Luxy doesnt want to waste their users time.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>So private jets and an only-attractive-and-wealthy-people-allowed-rule, Luxy has been known for more audacious things and are keen to maintain their exclusive status.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>But Luxys party is not the first singles event to be held for the successful. The League, deemed Tinder for the elites held numerous events earlier this year. Andrew M said, The League events were described as being a party for elite white people, where attendees talk about nothing but themselves and show nude pictures of girls to people they just met. This does not sound like very good party, Luxy will do better.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Unlike other dating apps, Luxy prizes itself purely on class, professional calibre and attractiveness. Andrew M said, Just because you went to an Ivy League University and made a few LinkedIn connections, it doesnt mean youre worth getting to know by default.

<p>Every day we get out, we can see lots of Chinese faces. Every year?the number of students studying abroad grows fast as usual. Access to the Chinese people is no longer a novelty.

He traveled to Taiwan, Japan, Korea and other places, spent 16 months full-time dating with Asia's young ladies. Obviously?he didnt step into China. Why Chinese ladies suffered such unfair treatment? There seems to be a thick barrier between Chinese and foreigners.

<p><i>Goodway Group Discusses the Future of Digital Marketing</i></p><p>PHILADELPHIA, PA  (Dec. 29, 2015) ¬ The 2015 digital marketing industry was dominated by native advertising, an increase in programmatic ad spending, hyper-segmentation and viewability. But as 2015 comes to a close, marketers are beginning to observe what digital marketing trends are going to arise in 2016.</p><p>Jay Friedman, chief operating officer of the programmatic ad tech firm Goodway Group, offers his predictions on what 2016 digital marketing trends are going to take hold and impact the industry:</p><p>	People-based Marketing  2016 will be the first year people-based marketing (rather than device-based or cookie-based for behaviors) really takes off. Facebook will launch their DSP and be the only player truly offering this option. This is a major game changer as advertisers will have a whole new understanding of the subject matter their audience will respond to in advertisements.</p><p>	Ad Blocking Leveling Out  Smart publishers will take control and start earning a fair price for their inventory. Theyll disallow ad blocking, and some will start to make 100 percent of their ad slots 100 percent viewable with infinite scroll ads. Publishers and consumers will be forced to find a happy medium between excessive ads and ad blockers, so both parties benefit in the end.</p><p>	Programmatic Specific Agencies  At least five major brands will select programmatic-specific agencies apart from their existing formal agency relationships in order to capitalize on advertisements. Conversely, many large regional or smaller national brands will still not be using their first-party data as of the first of the year.</p><p>	ROI  Market leaders will enable clear offline ROI tracking from online spend. This will allow them to analyze their process and content in order to make their digital campaigns even more effective while getting the best bang for their buck.</p><p>	ROI dislodges clutter metrics Those who are hyper-focused on viewability, fraud, ad blocking and all the other clutter will realize, it is all important, but its less important than measuring actual sales impact. While its important to pay attention to those clutter metrics, they should guide, not direct, as ROI is the ultimate stop.</p><p>For the first time, digital ad spending will surpass traditional television ad spending in the U.S. in 2016, indicating the ever-growing power of the digital marketing industry. Consequently, marketers are already preparing for next year to ensure advertising plans are effective and achieve top-notch results. &nbsp;</p><p>###</p><p><b>About Goodway Group</b></p><p>Goodway Group is a leading managed-services programmatic partner to local, regional and Fortune 500 brand agencies.

<p>Johannesburg, South Africa, 31 October 2015: Nomad Africa magazine project implores African governments to learn from South Africas recent visa regulation blunder. Avoidance of similar crises in future will certainly boost the continents travel and tourism industries.<br><br>In the previous year the South African government had made changes to the visa regulations that required parents to produce un-abridged birth certificates for their accompanying children. The government had not carefully considered the impact the changes would have on the nearly one tenth of the countrys GDP.<br><br>The move was seen by the South African (as well as African) travel and tourism industry players as a huge mistake. International tourists visiting South Africa, usually connected with other regional destinations as well.<br><br>Tourist numbers to South Africa (and some other countries in the region) had been seriously reduced, because travellers with children encountered severe administrative challenges. Many travel and tourism industry businesses were affected, losing millions in revenue and many industry jobs were threatened.<br><br>On Thursday 22nOctober 2015 the travel requirements were reviewed, making it possible for children to travel without birth certificates when they are from outside the South Africa<br><br>From the onset, it was surprising that our government could put the economic survival of 7,700,000 South African citizens (those whose livelihood depends on the tourism industry) at risk, when the new visa regulations were made into law, said Frederick Erasmus, Feature Editor of Nomad Africa magazine.<br><br>The results were very unfortunate as a previously growing industry was squashed by nearly 25%, year on year in one year, the past year, as a direct result of the injudicious travel regulations.<br><br>Associate Editor, Dieter Gottert comments, A country, specifically in Africa, should closely re-examine tourism policies if it adversely affects the financial income in terms of inhibiting overseas tourists from entering a country.<br><br>The goal is to generate wealth and maximize a countrys potential growth on the African continent, not stifle it and fix things when the damage has already been done. Foresight and prevention are better than curing ill-conceived political decisions, continues Gottert.<br><br>It was a pity the South African government omitted one very important step, and reports say that Southern Africa Tourism Services Association (Satsa) CEO David Frost, requested to know why the South African governments Inter Ministerial Committee made the decision without industry participation.<br><br>Nomad Africa Magazine project welcomed the review of the regulations, supporting the tourism industry hopes that the review will help to recover some of the cancelled trips by thousands of would-be visitors to South Africa.<br><br>Nomad Africa magazine project offers Africa a new impact voice globally, and our approach to African news coverage brings with it much needed perception management.<br><br>Our mission is to tell positively, the stories of Africa, which previously were usually negatively reported by the international media. Nomad Africa Magazine project has taken the responsibility to retell these stories with pride, and from an African perspective.<br><br>The prototype magazine of Nomad Africa magazine project first hit the shelves in July 2012 and was very positively received in Africa and internationally.

<p>The political crisis and internal disputes of Nigeria were in the headlines not long ago. But, now as everything settles, the people of the nation are bringing opportunities to grow businesses beyond boundaries. Partaking in such efforts,  founders of Kordahi technologies in Nigeria are bringing web reforms and advanced services for local enterprises. As, they are already a pioneer in providing outsourcing web solutions, their aim to solidify local markets have pushed them to make a step forward.</p><p>The top reason that CEO of kordahi foreseen such a tedious task is that, 90% of investors are foreigners. No matter how a web development company performs in Nigeria, the turnover will go overseas into the pockets of investors. Thats why to keep and grow the financial capital in ones own nation. Kordahi tech has introduced web services like website development &amp; designing, SEO marketing, Mobile app development, software testing and QA. The company is charging nominal for every kind of custom need of any size business.<br></p><p>The most popular kind of business in Nigeria is farming. The Nigerian ecosystem is still in abundance with open big farms and wood sources. But, sadly no further applications have been reinvented due to lack of information on technology running in other parts of the world. Thats why, Kordahi tech took one step forward to introduce special business doors in the form of web and mobile app pages. Presentation is all that matters. The farming and agriculture business has endless opportunities to create numerous products that can run businesses. As they have gold farming resources, their ability to present and showcase the product possibilities is limited. Kordahi Tech has aimed to empower these small farmers by giving them knowledge about marketing their products and in what ways.<br></p><p>Another kind of business that is slow caging onto the market is E-commerce. As, the inflation rate is still high in Nigeria, people need good quality products at low prices. ECommerce portals for small vendors offer stylish textiles, groceries, gaming accessories and a lot more categories online. This gives the people a choice at competitive prices. Most of the vendors even deal with good quality but old products. As, they come for a lower price, Nigerians strive for them.<br></p><p>Other Offline Service providers like construction and car wash use websites to represent their work, portfolios and defining their qualification and skills to give ace services.

<p>                                                </p><div>             <p>&nbsp;As a physician, you can easily blunt the effects of a few bad reviews by proactively building a positive internet reputation for your practice. Although the Internet is held accountable for creating some serious obstacles to doctor-patient relationships, it has also given rise to amazing medical resources for patients and physicians. Your online reputation is regarded as one of these potential obstacles caused by the internet. Today, everyone has to be concerned about their online reputation unlike in the past where managing ones reputation in the internet was considered the concern of politicians, celebrities and other famous people. The main reason behind this is simply because nowadays, about 40 percent of internet searches are those of individual names. This is the case whereby patients want to know more about their physicians.             </p>             <p> How a patient selects a doctor depends on various factors including referrals from other physicians, recommendations from friends, and even word of mouth. Therefore, when it comes to doctor selection, you will find that the online reviews and social media play an increasingly important role. According to one study, it was found out that when choosing a doctor, 60 percent of patients consider <b>CAHPS Surveys</b> very important while 40 percent rely on Social media for physician rating. At least to potential new patients, a poor online reputation can damage the doctors training and education hence portraying a bad picture. As a matter of fact, while using the same one-to-five-star system, websites that were originally designed to rank restaurants or hotels are now being used to review medical professionals. Just the way a poor rating can deter a consumer from trying a new hotel or restaurant is the same way it might keep a prospective patient from selecting a physician, with similar financial results.             </p>             <p> On the other hand, a physicians practice can also be negatively affected by the absence of online ratings and reviews. A 2015 study on &nbsp;<b>medical online reputation management </b>showed that 70 percent of the patients who could find some positive reviews about their doctors online trusted them more as compared to doctors who lacked online reviews at all. Therefore, this means that when a physician has some information about them online, then they are more likely to be selected by the patients who viewed their profile. As a doctor, you have to make the well-being of your patients a priority because you devoted many years of training and education for your career.             </p>             <p> It can be damaging both professionally and personally to doctors when a patient writes them a negative online review. However, it is highly advisable that you take negative online reviews with care and do not panic hence you should avoid taking them personally. From time to time, many physicians have come to realize many ways in which they can handle or deal with their negative online reviews from various types of patients. You should also learn to monitor your online reviews since it is the critical step when it comes to managing your online reputation. All in all, never panic because the results could turn out to be surprising and often times it includes a combination of positive feedback, misinformation, and even negative reviews. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>For More Information Please Visit : <a href="https://ormsurvey.com">https://ormsurvey.com</a></p>          </div>

<div>Legacy Central to Receive $100 Million Renovation</div><p>&nbsp;PLANO, TEXAS - (Jan. 5, 2016) - Regent Properties (Regent), a Los Angeles-based real estate investment and development firm with more than $1 billion under management, has announced the transformation of Legacy Centralthe office and mixed-use campus located at Legacy Drive and Central Expressway in Plano, Texasinto a modern, collaborative and highly amenitized corporate destination. Regent acquired the property Dec. 17, 2015.</p><p>&nbsp;The campus renovation will accommodate office tenants ranging from 25,000 to 1,000,000 square-feet in four existing buildings on 84 acres. Those buildings will be retrofitted while prime, undeveloped land will be readied for complementary uses, such as restaurants, a hotel, and retail, as well as additional mid-rise office buildings in the future. The site is entitled for up to 3.7 million square-feet, allowing large office tenants unique expansion opportunities via additional office buildings on a build-to-suit basis. A ground breaking is planned for the second quarter of 2016.</p><p>The property was acquired from Texas Instruments (TI), which had owned the site since the 1980s and built the four office buildings and fitness center for its own use. TI will lease back two of the buildings through 2016, finalizing a phase-out from the campus.</p><p>Legacy Central is a dynamic, technology-oriented office and mixed-use project offering a prime strategic location; unparalleled, on-site amenity base; and forward-thinking design in a campus environment centered on engaging and intimate outdoor spaces, said Eric Fleiss, President of Regent Properties. Regent will be investing more than $100 million to transform the site into a cutting-edge, first-class, creative office campus. Common area improvements will include landscaping, hardscaping, roadwork, common area amenities, building facades, building lobbies, and signage.</p><p>&nbsp;Included in the renovations will be:</p><p></p><ul><li>A variety of indoor and outdoor conference rooms<br></li><li>150-seat auditorium<br></li><li>30,000-square-foot fitness center; yoga rooms; lap swimming pool; sand volleyball court; tennis court; rock climbing wall; and full-sized, indoor basketball court<br></li><li>1-mile jogging/biking trail<br></li><li>Coffee kiosks<br></li><li>Campus-wide Wi-Fi<br></li><li>4-acre park<br></li><li>Abundant structured and surface parking of up to 5.5 per thousand rentable square-feet<br></li></ul><p></p><p>&nbsp;Common area work will be done in two phases: Phase 1 in 2016 and Phase 2 in 2017 after TI vacates.</p><p>TI intentionally designed the campus to be oriented toward a side street, away from U.S. Route 75. Regent Properties is reorienting the project toward Central Expressway and utilizing the vacant land along the highway for various complementary uses, such as a hotel, restaurants and retail. &nbsp;</p><p>Fleiss explained, The existing infrastructure (including oversized fitness center, large floorplates, and up to 14-foot clear heights) is unique in the Dallas market, very impressive, and very relevant to tenant demands in todays marketplaceand that is before a $100 million investment in updated architecture and lush landscape and hardscape improvements. We will provide a cutting-edge campus environment that is centered upon engaging outdoor spaces for meeting, working, collaborating, dining and relaxing. Further, the size of the site allows for additional amenities, and the highway frontage allows for strong access, visibility and a corporate presence along Central Expressway.</p><p>Plano has become THE corporate campus destination in North Texas. Plano is always at the top of the list for large employers looking for space in the Dallas area, and our project will deliver a forward-thinking campus experience which will facilitate their ability to attract and retain talent.</p><p>Planosupported by strong demographics, a desirable and educated labor force, and a high-quality school districtis the ideal place to live, work and play, and large corporations globally are recognizing these benefits. Regent Properties is already in discussions with several large companies, many of which are moving in from out-of-state and/or expanding local DFW presences.</p><p>Mayor Harry LaRosiliere of the City of Plano said, The city is very excited that Regent Properties is moving forward with its transformation of the Texas Instruments Spring Creek campus into Legacy Central. This project is another great example of the ongoing economic development momentum across Plano. Its yet another indication that Plano is the place where people want to live, work and play.</p><p>Regent is not new to DFW, having invested in the region for more than 20 years. It developed the 1,000-acre master planned community known as Post Oaks in Frisco, Texas. More recently, in 2012, Regent acquired, renovated and successfully repositioned the eight-story Bent Tree Tower II in Addison, Texas, which was nearly vacant when acquired, and in 2014, purchased another eight-story office tower, One Panorama Center, in Las Colinas, Texas.</p><p><b>About Regent Properties</b></p><p>Headquartered in Los Angeles, Regent Properties was established in 1989.

By Darius Snieckus  Tuesday, January 05 2016 Updated: Tuesday, January 05 2016&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>In a land with the transformational renewable-energy aspirations of India, Ravi Kailas ambitions are proportionately impressive. The company he set up a little over five years ago, Mytrah Energy, goes into 2016 with a financial war chest arming it to build out its generating capacity past 1GW, with a wind and solar portfolio of 3.5GW waiting to be developed.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Hyderabad-based independent power producers phenomenal growth  from a standing start in 2010 with $80m of equity  puts it on track to install some 200MW of wind a year for the near-term  then well see, Kailas tells Recharge.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Mytrah stands out in India because it is pioneering a one-stop-shop business model that gives it almost total control over projects  and is proving extremely fruitful, with its installed wind fleet having expanded steadily towards 750MW.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It is a self-determined approach that others might do well to emulate in one of the worlds biggest emerging renewables markets.&nbsp; </div><div><br></div><div>We do it all the way: from assessing the wind resource [it has 120 wind masts throughout the country] to developing the project to actually constructing it, owning and operating, and we do maintenance, asset management  everything except manufacturing our own turbines, he says. This is a unique business model in India.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Kailas approach to the nascent Indian renewable-energy market has necessarily been trailblazing. Mytrah has built up an asset base of ten wind farms in six states  Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu  using a combination of turnkey contracts and in-house project development, with turbines bought from five OEMs.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The diversification of the portfolio we have developed is important. We could have built our first 500MW in one or two locations. That would have been easier.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Yet by making it hard for ourselves we have achieved a number of things: we have a geographic diversity of cash flow for the longer term  some years there is more wind in the north, other years from other regions; we have relationships with multiple counterparties, as each state has its own electricity board; and, crucially, we have a better understanding of different regions wind regimes and how to build in mountainous areas, deserts, by the sea and so on.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The advantage we have comes from the knowledge of our sites  we can go to an OEM and say what the best turbine is for this site, what the best commercial terms are for this project. It is a much different proposition than going to a vendor and saying, What size of turbine do you have?  This strategy, he explains, marks out Mytrah as the first utility-scale pure-play renewables company in India. Believers include Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Apollo Funds, purchasers of a $130m bond issue last year.  Even in a relatively low wind year in 2015, revenues for Q3 were up year on year by 10% to $32m  and that will be much improved once the year is out.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Mytrah currently sells 643MW of wind power to state grids through 13-25-year power-purchase agreements, as well as 100.5MW directly to private customers on long-term deals.  In India, there is 270GW of existing installed power capacity but the latent demand is ten times that, so there is no shortage of customers now or, prospectively, in the longer term, says Kailas, who has founded a number of start-ups including telecom service and software companies Zip Global Network and Xius Technologies.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Though Mytrah has, to date, been ploughing its furrow as a wind farmer, the companys name  which derives from the Sanskrit for sun  betrays its wider, far-horizon aspirations. It recently won a substantial portion of the 350MW solar power auction in the state of Telangana, and has a 50MW lead-off PV project in Punjab.  We chose to wait to join the solar sector until this year [2015], until it was effectively subsidy-free. Now we are at that stage. And this coincides with the Indian governments setting out a very ambitious nationwide solar policy [to bring on line 100GW by 2020].  It looks like solar and wind will have an equal size and stake in Indias energy policy over the next five or ten years at least. It will not be a binary choice for the country.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>For us, that is a good balance to have.  The potential in India [compared to the forecast global renewable-energy build-out] is exponential. The need for power is so great. This is one of the most exciting energy markets now.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Courtesy <a href="http://www.rechargenews.com">www.rechargenews.com</a></div><div><br></div>

<p></p><p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is enriching our lives - transforming everyday experiences into an ecosystem of information via a network of digitally enabled objects. In the world of retail, IoT is a game changer  it allows companies to know their customer better and improve customer experiences and services. The IoT in the retail industry is rapidly growing  MarketsandMarkets forecasts that the IoT retail market will grow from US$ 14.4 Billion in 2015 to US$ 35.6 Billion in 2020.</p><div></div><div>IoT devices in retail  the role of beacons</div><div>There are several ways that IoT in retail is used  from advertising and mobile payments to managing inventory and tracking theft and loss, leading to enhanced customer experiences and increased revenue. By using various IoT devices such as point of sale, card readers, inventory management, scanners, cameras, sensors, beacons, digital signage and more, retailers will be able to increase revenue and boost customer experience. </div><div></div><div>Beacons are an intrinsic component of the IoT, and play an important role in the retail industry, benefiting both the customer and the retailer. Beacons such as <b>EKOOR</b> beacons are small wireless devices that constantly send out a low power Bluetooth signal to smart phones and smart devices in range, and can be used to provide personally addressed context relevant information. </div><div></div><div>How customers benefit from <b>EKOOR</b> beacons</div><div><img title="Image httpwwwucarecdncom98d76268-7847-45e8-a3da-33f20236b766" alt="" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/robin8-production/robin8-production/98d76268-7847-45e8-a3da-33f20236b766/untitled.png"></div><div>Beacons enhance a customers experience by engaging shoppers and increasing interest. Beacons send out personalized greetings, on-going promotions, sale alerts and more to customers when they enter the store or are next to a specific product. In addition, customized coupons can be sent to customers upon entry based on previous shopping experiences. </div><div></div><div>Customers can also find out more about a product that interests them using beacon technology, where beacons can track customers close to a certain display and point them to the online store that displays product information and reviews. Beacons can also be programmed to be used as a method of payment and receive payment information from smart devices.  </div><div></div><div>How retailers benefit from EKOOR beacons</div><div></div><div>Beacons help improve efficiency of a business, and can be used to collect data on shopping habits of customers, providing useful analytics and insights to improve and customize customers experience. Information such as how frequently customers come to your store, how long they stay in certain areas, which routes they use etc can be used to plan out floor displays to maximize efficiency. Analytics can also pinpoint which products received the most attention and engagement. </div><div></div><div></div><div><b>EKOOR</b> is transforming the IOT market by making green friendly smart things. It is estimated that there would be billions of smart devices connecting to the internet in the coming years and a good majority of these devices send/receive data only for several times a day. Therefore the overall power consumption is low and make them ideal candidates to harness energy from alternative power sources. Light Powered Proximity Beacons are EKOORs first product while there are number of other initiatives underway to address different IOT verticals. EKOOR is also developing an IOT cloud platform to enable end-to-end connectivity and application development with any IOT device.   </div><div></div><div><b>EKOOR</b> is currently running a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds to help its Beacon production efforts and also lay the foundation for future Green IOT initiatives</div><div></div><p>Visit at : <a href="http://kck.st/1PKbhOe">http://kck.st/1PKbhOe</a><br></p><p></p>

<p>Horsham, PA -- January 7, 2016 -- The 2015 Cottman $100,000 Sweepstakes ended without anyone claiming the grand prize. But Tracy Davis of Everett, Washington, had the closest match to win the bonus prize of $1000. </p><p>The Cottman $100,000 Sweepstakes began on October 1 to coincide with the start of National Car Care month, and ran till November 30. The object of the event was to focus attention on the importance of maintaining your car. </p><p>Heres how the sweepstakes worked: The Cottman technical department chose ten common vehicle maintenance services, which were placed in a specific order and then randomized. </p><p>Contestants accessed the random list from the sweepstakes web site, which was available through the many Cottman web sites and on Facebook. The object was to try to match the original order: Anyone who placed all ten in the correct order would win the $100,000. No one matched all ten, but Davis came closest, earning the bonus prize of $1000. </p><p>I ran into the contest on Facebook, says Davis. The graphics caught my attention, and it looked like itd be fun to give it a try. So I filled out the application, made my selections, and clicked enter. I dont know anything about cars  Im in pharmaceuticals  but I tried to think like a mechanic and chose what would be most important to them. </p><p>Looks like it was a good strategy. And, with the holidays right around the corner, the prize couldnt have come at a better time for Davis and her husband, Michael. According to Cottman Director of Advertising Sue Burg, people from all across the country took part in the sweepstakes. Id like to congratulate Tracy for winning the bonus prize and thank all those who participated in this years sweepstakes, she said. While Cottman is sorry no one won the grand prize, they were thrilled with the response to the sweepstakes and are planning to follow it up with another contest next year. </p><p>To learn more about Cottman Transmission and Total Auto Care, to watch for new Cottman sweepstakes, or to find a Cottman center near you, visit them on line at <a href="http://www.cottman.com">www.cottman.com</a>.<br></p><p><b>About Cottman Transmission and Total Auto Care: </b></p><p>With locations across the U.S., Cottman Transmission and Total Auto Care is a transmission and auto repair brand that services almost any make or model vehicle, foreign or domestic.

LAS VEGAS, Jan. 6, 2016  With its first live over-the-air broadcast of 4K Ultra HD TV with high dynamic range (HDR) using the new ATSC 3.0 Candidate Standard, digital television pioneer LG Electronics (LG) is ushering in the era of next-generation television broadcasting at CES® 2016.<br><br>The landmark broadcast, from Las Vegas station KHMP-TVs transmitter on Nevadas Black Mountain, is delivering pristine 4K HDR content, received for the first time on LGs new ATSC 3.0-enabled receivers at the Las Vegas Convention Center. The signal has stunning detail with four times the resolution of todays HDTV and offers the lifelike realism of HDRs enhanced contrast, brightness and shadow detail.<br><br>KHMP Channel 18, owned and operated by DNV Spectrum Holdings, a broadcast group that also owns other stations in the United States, is broadcasting in Las Vegas using the ATSC 3.0 Physical Layer Candidate Standard under an experimental broadcast license from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. Core technologies developed by LG are included in the majority of the Physical Layer Candidate Standard.<br><br>The transmission field trial during CES exemplifies the very robust transmission and high bandwidth for 4K made possible for the first time using the ATSC 3.0 next-generation standard developed by the Advanced Television Systems Committee.<br><br>We are proud that LG technology is behind the majority of the elements of the Physical Layer transmission system, said Dr. Skott Ahn, president and chief technology officer, LG Electronics. ATSC 3.0 is a collaborative effort among many broadcast technology experts, and LG technology is part of at least 10 of the 15 building blocks of the new Candidate Standard.<br><br>Among the many LG contributions to ATSC 3.0, the companys technologies are included in the Physical Layer Candidate Standards scrambler, forward error correction, bit-interleaver, mapper, MIMO, time-interleaver, OFDM framer, frequency-interleaver, pilot and tone reserve, and guard interval.<br><br>Thanks in large part to LGs technology at the heart of the Physical Layer Candidate Standard, this robust system will bring a new level of flexibility for broadcasters and exciting new services for viewers. ATSC 3.0 promises to usher in the new Golden Age of broadcast television, Ahn added.<br><br>Expected to redefine TV broadcasting for decades to come, the ATSC 3.0 next-generation broadcast standard provides higher capacity to deliver 4K UHD services, robust reception on mobile devices and improved spectrum efficiency. The increased payload capacity of the physical layer combined with HEVC encoding will allow broadcasters many more options when planning their broadcast service offerings.<br><br>LG is leading the way in development and commercialization of ATSC 3.0 in the U.S. and in Korea, said Ahn, who explained that this weeks Las Vegas broadcast comes on the heels of other broadcast field trials conducted in the United States and South Korea over the past 18 months by LG Electronics, its U.S. R&amp;D Lab Zenith, and leading broadcast equipment provider GatesAir.<br><br>Those real-world field tests in Seoul, Cleveland, Ohio, and Madison, Wisconsin, represented key mileposts in LGs pioneering developments of core technologies behind the new ATSC 3.0 Standard, he said. The Las Vegas CES broadcast, with the approved ATSC Candidate Standard transmission system, again shows how we are partnering with broadcasters around the world to drive adoption of next-generation broadcasting technology.<br><br>Development of ATSC 3.0 technologies represents the latest collaboration among LG, Zenith and GatesAir, co-inventors of the transmission system behind the ATSC A/153 Mobile Digital TV Standard, adopted by the industry in 2009. Zenith invented the core transmission system at the heart of todays ATSC A/53 Digital Television Standard, approved by the Federal Communications Commission in 1996.<br><br>LG Electronics, Inc.

Additional research shows that maintaining a well-balanced skin microbiome with a daily dose of topical probiotics applied to the skin may be just as important as oral probiotics for a healthy GI tract.</p><p>&nbsp;How do skin probiotics work?  The tiny molecular messages packaged into probiotics fit skin cells like a lock-and-key, and send skin-balancing messages to help the skin to look younger, improve its hydration, and stimulate the skin immune system.  However, if the right amount and type of these tiny bacterial signals are not present, an out-of-balance skin microbiome can result. Research shows that an imbalanced skin microbiome is associated with, and may even promote, skin conditions such as eczema, acne, and rosacea, as well as skin aging.  Common skin exposure such as soaps, environmental toxins and irritants, and even many skin care products can damage the skin microbiome.  For these reasons, skin with its billions of bacterial friends deserves daily probiotic support, just like your GI tract.</p><p>&nbsp;What does skin on probiotics look like?  Well, it depends on the quality of the probiotic.  The vast majority of probiotics are taken from animals, food or soil.  These probiotics -- called xenobiotics -- are not native to the human body.  BioEsse® Probiotic Essence for the Skin is the only skin care system containing patent-pending, concentrated BellaCell®, a probiotic sourced from the human microbiome, and which therefore naturally belongs on the human body.  BellaCell® and the skin care system BioEsse® &nbsp;(facial cleanser, serum, lotion, and eye cream) were discovered and developed at Quorum Innovations (Sarasota, FL). &nbsp;</p><p>BioEsse® clinical tests show results in 2 weeks, with improved skin texture, more even complexion and less facial redness, decreased fine lines, wrinkles and pores, improved skin hydration, and frequently, a new-found skin "glow" reported by many BioEsse® consumers.  BioEsse® Probiotic Essence for the Skin contains dermatologist-recommended topical probiotics, which promote healthy skin bacteria.  The BioEsse® line is an eco-luxe, "green" skin care line, containing only 100% naturally-derived, pure ingredients, minus the heavy, toxic preservatives, chemicals and synthetic ingredients that can damage skin and overall health.  BioEsse® is all about the probiotic technology, comment Dr. Nicholas Monsul, and Dr. Eva Berkes, clinical physicians and co-founders of Quorum Innovations.<br></p><p>&nbsp;<b><i>About Bioesse</i></b><b>®</b></p><p>                                                     </p><p><a href="http://www.bioesseprobiotics.com"><b><i>Bioesse</i>®</b></a><b> </b>is based upon bio-identical probiotic technology clinical skincare powered by the human microbiome.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.bioesseprobiotics.com"><b><i>Bioesse</i>®</b></a> integrates skincare into a <i>Whole Health</i> philosophy.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.bioesseprobiotics.com"><b><i>Bioesse</i>®</b></a><b> </b>believes in a natural harmony between beauty and health.&nbsp; Its products are 100% natural with&nbsp;0% toxins.&nbsp; Medicine has gone far afield for cures  the seas, the rain forest, and synthetic chemicals.&nbsp; But the <a href="http://www.bioesseprobiotics.com"><b><i>Bioesse</i>®</b></a> science  the science of the human microbiome - has simply, quietly gone home, to our very origin, the human body - where we may have the best of medicines waiting for us right there, all along.&nbsp; We believe our clients will enjoy experiencing the <a href="http://www.bioesseprobiotics.com"><b><i>Bioesse</i>®</b></a> difference  Beauty in Balance. <a href="http://www.bioesseprobiotics.com"><b><i>Bioesse</i>®</b></a> 2068 Hawthorne St. Suite 201 Sarasota, Florida 34239 |<a href="mailto:info@bioesseprobiotics.com">info@bioesseprobiotics.com</a> | <a href="http://www.bioesseprobiotics.com" title="Link: http://www.bioesseprobiotics.com">www.bioesseprobiotics.com</a> | (941)953-2238. </p>

<p>SILICON VALLEY, CA -- (January 08, 2016) -- <a href="http://www.onluxy.com" target="_blank">LUXY</a>&nbsp;App (<a href="http://www.onluxy.com">www.onluxy.com</a>), the dating site that caters to the 1% crowd, has surveyed more than 1,400 wealthy men and women on the subject of Personal Technology &amp; Dating. <a href="http://www.onluxy.com" target="_blank">LUXY</a> App asked its members about their personal preferences, with questions like: Which is more impressive on a date? Apple Watch or Rolex? Men and women seem to have totally different views of these brands and  at least outside of Silicon Valley  Apple isnt always the most impressive. </p><p>Since launching in 2014, the <a href="http://www.onluxy.com" target="_blank">LUXY</a>&nbsp;dating app has witnessed more than 500K downloads in less than six months. During this time, thousands of people have identified their luxury brand preferences on their dating profiles  and <a href="http://www.onluxy.com" target="_blank">LUXY</a>&nbsp; has compiled and ranked those luxury brands preferred by our wealthy single members. <a href="http://www.onluxy.com" target="_blank">LUXY</a>&nbsp;App has also surveyed its members directly to learn about Personal Technology &amp; Dating with all the hype surrounding Apple.</p><p>With the launch of Apple Watch 2 rumored to be realized in March this year, it could follow the same underwhelming response as the first. The BBC reported that 19% of Britons would purchase one smart gadget in 2016, costing no more than £150. </p><p>The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) showcased new smartwatch FitBit. Chief executive, James Park said there will be a heavy focus on personalisation and fitness, costing just over half of the cheapest Apple Watch. FitBits simplicity and price could be key to rivalling Apple. But are smart watches really what the customer wants? <a href="http://www.onluxy.com" target="_blank">LUXY</a>&nbsp;posed this question to the elite 1%. </p><p>Time Will Tell? Apple Watch vs. Rolex </p><p><a href="http://www.onluxy.com" target="_blank">LUXY</a>s first interesting finding was that rich single men clearly prefer Apple Watch over Rolex (72% versus 28%). Since its launch in April last year  after months of hype  its been hard to ignore the Apple Watch. It only costs a few hundred dollars on the low end so why do our wealthy male millionaires favor the iDevice over the more traditional, classic Rolex watch? Certainly our pop culture-obsessed generation cant get enough of the latest gadges and gizmos ...and celebs have been seen wearing them all over town (thanks to free watches from Apple), wrote Marie C,&nbsp;PR Representative for <a href="http://www.onluxy.com" target="_blank">LUXY</a>&nbsp;App. Even though Rolex watches tend to hold their value, its not clear whether an Apple Watch will even be relevant in 12-18 months. </p><p>What Do Women Like To See on Their Man? Hint: Not Apple.<br> It turns out, women feel much differently about things; nearly 80% of females surveyed selected Rolex over Apple Watch. Why? While men may see Apple as disrupting the old, established, status-driven watch industry, women seem to appreciate the status surrounding Rolex? </p><p>43% of women said they would rather date a man wearing a Rolex instead of the most expensive 18-karat rose gold Apple Watch edition. We predict the Apple Watch 2 will be another flop said Marie, consumers get excited because its come from Apple. But how many people do you see wearing the first Apple Watch today?"&nbsp;</p><p>More Brand Preference Surveys To Come<br><a href="http://www.onluxy.com" target="_blank">LUXY</a>&nbsp;will be re-visiting these brand preferences on a regular basis and our next brand preference rankings will focus on fashion and travel. Heres a bit more about the <a href="http://www.onluxy.com" target="_blank">LUXY</a>&nbsp;app itself. </p><p>ABOUT <a href="http://www.onluxy.com" target="_blank">LUXY</a>&nbsp; APP: TINDER MINUS THE POOR PEOPLE<br> It works just like Tinder, said the CEO of <a href="http://www.onluxy.com" target="_blank">LUXY</a>.&nbsp; With one big exception: Our app is for wealthy people only. Its basically Tinder minus the poor people. </p><p>It was really just a matter of time. With Tinder, Grindr and others carving out a niche for themselves in the world of high-speed digital dating, <a href="http://www.onluxy.com" target="_blank">LUXY</a>&nbsp; has launched to work in the same way.<br> Its Tinder without low-income dating prospects. In fact, the average income of male users on LUXY is over $200k. </p><p>Like Tinder, based on the results of potential candidates, the app allows the user to anonymously like or pass them by swiping or tapping. If two users like each other then it results in a "Match" and <a href="http://www.onluxy.com" target="_blank">LUXY</a>&nbsp;introduces the two users and opens a chat. </p><p>Who doesnt want to date somebody both attractive and wealthy? Privately, we all know we prefer to have both of these things. One user said: Tinder was pretty awesome when it came out, but theres a lot of riff raff on there. [I] would rather know the guy has a couple bucks in his pocket. </p><p>With the rise of high-speed digital dating, its about time somebody introduced a filter to weed out low-income prospects by neighborhood, said the CEO of <a href="http://www.onluxy.com" target="_blank">LUXY</a>.<br> </p><p>Another user wrote: Does this mean that were all going to flock to Beverly Hills on a Friday night to make a match?

<p>HORSHAM, PA. --&nbsp;January 11th, 2016   --   In many parts of the country, where unusually warm weather has prevailed, winter may seem far away.  But colder weather, snow and ice will be coming, even if belated, and the experts at Cottman Transmission and Total Auto Care, a national brand that services virtually any make and model vehicle, encourage car owners to prepare now for winter driving.</p><p>The experts at Cottman offer some simple tips to keep your car running smoothly and safely during the winter months ahead.</p><p>Dont neglect your tires, says Randy Wright President of Cottman Transmission and Total Auto Care.  Be sure your tires are safe, with good tread, and keep them properly inflated.   As temperatures dip, tires lose about a pound of pressure for every ten-degree drop.  Randy also recommends using all-season tires with good tread, rather than so-called high-performance tires that dont perform well in heavy rain and snow. &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>Its a good idea to keep extra salt or sand in the car, since even the best tires can lose traction on an icy incline.  Wright suggests keeping a piece of old carpeting in the trunk.  If you get stuck on ice, place the carpet in front of the drive wheels to give the tires something to grab onto to help get the car moving.</p><p>After traction, visibility is a crucial driving issue, especially in winter weather.  Its important to keep windows clear.  Replace wiper blades with winter-style blades, refill the washer fluid and keep spare fluid in the car.  Also, remember to wipe headlights and tail lights before you drive, since ice, remnants of snow and dried dirt from messy roads can substantially diminish forward visibility and make it difficult for cars behind to see you.</p><p>Weak or dead batteries are another major winter driving problem. Cottman says a simple load test can indicate whether your battery has enough power for cold-weather starts.  Its also a good idea to have the battery terminals cleaned to allow full power to flow from the battery to the starter.</p><p>Be sure to have your anti-freeze checked before freezing temperatures arrive.  Anti-freeze protects water in the radiator and engine block from freezing and cracking, which could lead to costly repairs.</p><p>                            Drivers should take a tip from the Boy Scout motto  Be prepared.   Small things like keeping lock de-icer in your coat or purse can help keep you from getting locked out. &nbsp;</p><p>Having extra sweaters and blankets in the car can keep you warm if you get stranded and have to wait in freezing cold until help arrives.  Flares can help warn other drivers if you get stuck and they can also draw the attention of police to help you.  Be sure your cell phone is fully charged so you can call for help.</p><p>Traffic safety experts say not to speed and to drive extra carefully in winter weather.  Be sure to slow down on curves and watch for black ice, which can accumulate on roadways and especially on bridges.</p><p>The Cottman experts encourage drivers to check their owners manual to see what specific steps are recommended for winter care for their car.</p><p>To keep your car running safely and smoothly on tough winter days, some basic advance planning and extra driving caution are easy steps to take, Cottmans Wright says.</p><p><b>About Cottman Transmission and Total Auto Care:</b></p><p>With locations across the U.S., Cottman Transmission and Total Auto Care is a transmission and auto repair brand that services almost any make or model vehicle, foreign or domestic.

<h4>Alliance to Focus on Development and Commercialization of Regenerative Medicine Products for Stroke and Other Potential Indications Using New Regulatory Framework in Japan</h4><div><p><b>CLEVELAND and TOKYO, Jan. 08, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE)</b>&nbsp; Healios K.K. (Healios) (Tokyo Stock Exchange: 4593) and Athersys, Inc. (Athersys) (<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=athx">ATHX</a>) have announced a partnership and license agreement that will focus on the development and commercialization of novel cell therapy treatments, including MultiStem® for the treatment of ischemic stroke and potentially other indications, in Japan. The partnership involves MultiStem, a proprietary, patented off-the-shelf stem cell therapy being developed by Athersys, with an initial focus on treating ischemic stroke.</p><p>Under the terms of the agreement, Healios will gain exclusive rights for the development of MultiStem for treating ischemic stroke in Japan. Healios will develop and commercialize the product in Japan, and Athersys will provide the manufactured product and support to Healios, while retaining all rights outside of Japan. In addition, Healios will obtain an exclusive option for development of two additional MultiStem clinical indications in Japan, including the treatment of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which is currently in clinical development by Athersys in the United States (U.S.) and the United Kingdom (U.K.), and another indication in the orthopaedic area. Healios will also obtain an exclusive license to incorporate Athersys technology in the development and commercialization of its proprietary Healios organ bud technology, initially for transplantation to treat liver disease or dysfunction, which may be expanded upon exercise of the option.</p><p>Stroke represents a major problem, both in Japan and globally. Currently available treatments such as tPA and mechanical thrombectomy must be administered within the first several hours after the stroke occurs, limiting treatment to a small percentage of patients, and such interventions may also pose certain risks, observed Dr. Kiyohiro Houkin, Chairman and Professor of Neurosurgery of Hokkaido University Medical School, and President of Hokkaido University Hospital. The recently conducted international clinical study by Athersys in the U.S. and the U.K. suggests that intravenous administration of MultiStem within 36 hours of the occurrence of a stroke is safe, well-tolerated, and is a beneficial and effective treatment. The off-the-shelf administration of the product could be a simple and universal approach for treating acute stroke patients. Furthermore, it could be administered to patients that do not arrive at the hospital in time to receive current standard of care, or alternatively could be administered in addition to tPA or mechanical reperfusion, potentially enhancing outcomes for patients that have suffered significant strokes. If efficacy is confirmed in additional studies, it is possible that this therapy could become the new standard of care for treating stroke, concluded Dr. Houkin.</p><p>As part of the license, Athersys will receive an initial license fee of $15 million, as well as have the opportunity to earn milestone and royalty payments upon the successful accomplishment of specific development and commercialization objectives, including the achievement of certain sales milestones.  Development and approval milestones for stroke could total $30 million, in addition to sales milestones that could reach $185 million based on successful commercialization and the achievement of substantial sales of an approved product for treating stroke in Japan. Athersys will also receive tiered, double-digit royalties increasing into the high teens on product sales and will be responsible for providing manufactured product to Healios, subject to receiving reimbursement under a manufacturing supply arrangement. Furthermore, if Healios elects to expand the partnership following the successful completion of Athersys ongoing clinical trial in ARDS, Athersys will receive a license expansion fee of $10 million for the exclusive rights to two additional indications in Japan, with the corresponding potential for further milestones based on successful achievement of specific development and commercialization objectives. As part of the expanded alliance, Healios will also have the right to incorporate Athersys technology in other organ bud indications.</p><p>Japan currently represents the second largest national market for prescription biopharmaceuticals in the world. The country is also experiencing a significant demographic shift that is resulting in a rapid and unprecedented expansion of the elderly population in Japan, which threatens to pose significant challenges for the national healthcare system over the next several decades. In order to help address the challenges posed by the potential increased demand for healthcare resources as a result of this expanding population, over the past two years policy-makers in Japan have revised the regulatory framework to focus on promoting the development of innovative new therapies that are demonstrated to be safe and that also provide promising signs of effectiveness. These recently implemented regulatory reforms, which are specifically designed to promote development of novel regenerative medicine therapies, are intended to speed the development of promising new medicines for patients where there is substantial unmet medical need.</p><p>Athersys proprietary cell therapy product, MultiStem, has been evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical study for ischemic stroke in the U.S. and U.K. and is also in clinical development in several other indication areas, including the treatment of ARDS, myocardial infarction, and for transplant support, including prevention of Graft versus Host Disease and liver transplant support. Athersys has begun preparations for clinical development in Japan, including engagement with the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in Japan (PMDA). Healios and Athersys have already met jointly with PMDA and plan to complete additional preparations for initiation of a clinical study in Japan for stroke, with commencement of the study expected in the second half of 2016.</p><p>I am very pleased that an exclusive licensing contract has been concluded with Athersys over development and distribution in Japan of MultiStem, a candidate pharmaceutical product for innovative cytotherapy having undergone phase 2 clinical trials in U.S. and U.K. There seems to be a large market need for MultiStem that can expand the period allowed before the start of treatment for ischemic stroke. Successful development of this product under the new regenerative medicine framework in Japan could accelerate Healios ability to help patients, achieve profitable operations and deliver substantial value to our shareholders, commented Dr. Tadahisa Hardy Kagimoto, President of Healios. Beyond stroke, the technology by Athersys is expected to improve the efficiency of production also when we prepare the organ as a platform for clinical transplantation programs. In essence, Healios has acquired a catalyst that can accelerate commercialization in the field of iPSC-based regenerative medicine products.</p><div></div><p>Healios is recognized as a leading regenerative medicine company in Japan, with a technology portfolio that includes the development of retinal pigmented epithelia cells produced from induced pluripotent stem cells for the treatment of age related macular degeneration (AMD).  Healios obtained a license to the technology from RIKEN to develop a novel treatment for AMD in 2013. Healios has also licensed additional technology from Yokohama City University related to the development of organ buds for transplantation indications. Healios is partnered with Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd. and SHIBUYA CORPORATION (a leading robotics company in Japan), as well as NIKON CORPORATION and Osaka University who are focused on the joint development of advanced manufacturing capabilities for regenerative medicine therapies.</p><p>Athersys is excited to be working with Healios for the development of MultiStem in Japan with an initial focus on treating patients that have suffered an ischemic stroke.  Healios has an experienced and accomplished leadership team that recognizes the importance and transformational potential of the regenerative medicine field.  They also have a compelling vision for our collaboration that includes the potential to work together across several important indication areas in a highly focused and efficient manner, which is why we selected them as our new partner, said Dr. Gil Van Bokkelen, Chairman and CEO at Athersys. They have a strong balance sheet, an excellent network of institutional partners and collaborators, and they are committed to rapid and efficient development under the new regulatory framework in Japan, all of which are key factors for success.</p><p><b>About Ischemic Stroke</b></p><p>Stroke represents an area where the clinical need is particularly significant, since it represents a leading cause of death and significantly lowers quality of life for many stroke victims. Currently, there are more than 15 million people that suffer a stroke globally and more than two million stroke victims each year in the United States, Europe and Japan, combined. Ischemic strokes, which represent the most common form of stroke, are caused by a blockage of blood flow in the brain that cuts off the supply of oxygen and nutrients and can result in tissue loss and neurological damage, as well as long-term or permanent disability. Unfortunately, current therapeutic options for ischemic stroke victims are limited, since the only available therapies, administration of the clot dissolving agent tPA, or thrombolytic, or surgical intervention using mechanical reperfusion to remove the clot, must be conducted within several hours of the occurrence of the stroke. As a consequence of this limited time window, only a small percentage of stroke victims are treated with the currently available therapymost simply receive supportive or palliative care. The long-term costs of stroke are substantial, with many patients requiring extended hospitalization, extended physical therapy or rehabilitation (for those patients that are capable of entering such programs), and many require long-term institutional or family care.</p><p><b>About MultiStem</b></p><p>MultiStem cell therapy is a patented regenerative medicine product that has shown the ability to promote tissue repair and healing in a variety of ways, such as through the production of therapeutic factors produced in response to signals of inflammation and tissue damage.  MultiStem therapys potential for multidimensional therapeutic impact distinguishes it from traditional biopharmaceutical therapies focused on a single mechanism of benefit. The product represents a unique off-the-shelf stem cell product that can be manufactured in a scalable manner, may be stored for years in frozen form, and is administered without tissue matching or the need for immune suppression. Based upon its efficacy profile, its novel mechanisms of action, and a favorable and consistent safety profile demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical settings, MultiStem therapy could provide a meaningful benefit to patients, including those suffering from serious diseases and conditions with unmet medical need. Athersys has forged strategic partnerships and a broad network of collaborations to develop MultiStem cell therapy for a variety of indications, with an initial focus in the neurological, cardiovascular and inflammatory and immune disorder areas.</p><p><b>About Athersys, Inc.</b></p><p>Athersys is an international biotechnology company engaged in the discovery and development of therapeutic product candidates designed to extend and enhance the quality of human life. The Company is developing its MultiStem cell therapy product, a patented, adult-derived off-the-shelf stem cell product, initially for disease indications in the cardiovascular, neurological, inflammatory and immune disease areas, and has several ongoing clinical trials evaluating this potential regenerative medicine product. Athersys has forged strategic partnerships and collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as world-renowned research institutions to further develop its platform and products.

<div><p>Do you know everything you need to know about your <a title="Link: http://iracontributionlimits2010.com/roth-ira-contribution-limits-for-20102011/2010/09/" target="_blank" href="http://iracontributionlimits2010.com/roth-ira-contribution-limits-for-20102011/2010/09/">2016 IRA Contribution Limits</a>?  Did you know the IRS changed these limits from 2015? Federal  regulations that cover annual Roth, Traditional, Simple and SEP IRAs,  your overall <a href="http://iracontributionlimits2010.com/401k-contribution-limits-for-2011/2010/10/">401k limits</a>, as well as income limits for all accounts are in flux.</p> <p>Each year, the IRS changes the rules governing individual retirement accounts, so it is important to <a href="http://finance.boston.com/boston/news/read?GUID=14319330">stay current</a> on the new regulations for your IRA, especially when opening a Roth IRA.</p> <p>Two sets of Rules. The rules that govern your annual maximum contribution to your <a href="http://irasuccess.com/compare-ira-brokers">individual retirement account</a>  depend upon your age: one set of regulations if you are under 50 this  year, and another set of rules if you turn 50 or older this year.</p> <p>If you are under 50 in 2016, the maximum IRA limit for contributions  that you can make is five thousand five-hundred dollars, up to the  amount you made in taxable income this year. So if you only made four  thousand dollars this year, this is the maximum you can contribute. This  applies to both <a href="http://irasuccess.com/what-is-the-difference-between-a-roth-and-a-traditional-ira-account/">traditional and Roth IRA limits</a>.</p> <p>If you turn 50 or older this year the most you can contribute to your  individual retirement account is six thousand five-hundred dollars, up  to but not exceeding your 2015/16 taxable income.  This amount includes  the five thousand five hundred dollar limit that everyone qualifies for,  as well as an addition one thousand catch-up contribution.  Income  limits apply!</p> <p>In 2015 the annual limit for your IRA contribution was five thousand  five hundred dollars, for those 50 and under. If you were over 50 in  2015, the catch-up contribution rules increased your maximum limit to  six thousand five hundred dollars.</p> <p>Maximums for Roth IRAs are the same, but keep the following in mind.  The rules above apply to both traditional and Roth IRAs.  If you have  both types of accounts, it is important to know that the annual limits  above apply to combined contributions.  So for example, if you  are under 50, you can invest two thousand dollars into your traditional  IRA and up to a three thousand five-hundred <a href="http://iracontributionlimits2010.com/roth-ira-contribution-limits-for-20102011/2010/09/">maximum into your 2016 Roth IRA</a>,  or any other combination as long as the total doesnt exceed five  thousand five-hundred dollars.  If you are over 50, any combination of  investment up to six thousand five hundred dollars is allowed by the  federal government.</p> <p>Upper income limits also apply! Read about <a target="_blank" href="http://iracontributionlimits2010.com/roth-rules/2011/10/">Roth IRA Rules for 2016</a> for more information on these restrictions. (for Traditional IRA limits, see below.)</p> <h2>Essential Individual Retirement Account Information:</h2> <p>1. 2016 Traditional IRA Income Limits. The <a href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/index.html">federal government</a>  places upper limits on how much you can contribute to a traditional  IRA, which varies from individual to individual. The limits are based on  age, tax filing status and your modified AGI  or your adjusted gross  income.

<p>It seems that weve been hearing more and more lately about the financial crisis that is affecting those</p><p>in France, Greece, and Italy  and rightly so  because even though these countries are a world away,</p><p>the situation they are facing is affecting the prices we pay for goods and services, as well as the</p><p>incoming cash flow that is being received in the institutional fixed income market.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, although investment grade corporate bonds produced a return of 8.15 percent last year  and</p><p>outperforming most other asset classes  they did not outperform the return of U.S. Treasuries.</p><p>A large part of this entails the fact that 2011 ended with the corporate year?end yield barely higher than</p><p>the lows it saw last summer. This, coupled with the downgrade of United States debt and the</p><p>heightening of the European crisis, created a recipe for jittery institutional investors as well as a</p><p>potential drying up for European corporate bonds.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Overall Volatility</b></p><p>Even more so than over the past decade, the volatility of the market has become more frequent ever</p><p>since the Greek crisis started several years ago, and particularly so since this past summer when</p><p>Standard &amp; Poors downgraded the United States credit rating.</p><p>Certainly, as the market moves up and down, so does the worry and concern of those who are invested</p><p> and in particular those who are depending upon a certain amount of income from fixed investments,</p><p>thus leaving fixed income investors are concerned that they may be better off keeping their funds in</p><p>Treasury alternatives or even in cash.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Euro Debt and U.S. Banks</b></p><p>It has been estimated that some of the major United States banks are exposed to over $700 billion in</p><p>debt from Ireland, Greece, and Italy, as well as some of the other hard hit European economies.</p><p>Depending upon how the crisis of the euro zone ends up, however, that debt could be worth a great</p><p>deal less than expected due in large part to a substantial amount of write offs. The bad news is that</p><p>these write offs may have an impact on investors around the globe.</p><p>As an example, if a bank held approximately $1 billion in Greek debt, and a debt reduction burden of 50</p><p>percent was to be approved, then the bank would need to write off the value of the debt by $500</p><p>million, essentially forcing a 50 percent loss on the holders of that debt.</p><p>What would the effect of this be? In essence, that bank would have to reserve against the 50 percent of</p><p>the value that had been lost. This, in turn, would harm the future earnings of the bank, in addition to</p><p>also having a negative effect on the price of its stock shares.</p><p>This is a similar situation to the recent subprime mortgage crisis in the United States where banks and</p><p>other lenders were required to write down their holdings of these mortgages. This essentially led to</p><p>lenders tightening credit to both consumers and businesses.</p><p>There is a high likelihood of seeing this situation occur again in Greece  and possibly Italy as well if the</p><p>situation is to spread. This being the case, the ripple effect could cause an impairment on the continued</p><p>Unites States recovery that would not just continue to impair lending and credit, but also job creation</p><p>as well.</p><p><br></p><p><b>The Price of Goods and Services</b></p><p>This ripple effect could greatly hinder the United States export market as well. According to the United</p><p>States Census Bureau, roughly 16 percent of total U.S. exports go to just six of our European export</p><p>partners, including Germany, France, and Britain. Based on this, the total United States investment is</p><p>three times higher in the European Union than it is for all of Asia.</p><p>What this means is that due to the spreading of the debt crisis there, the United States European export</p><p>partners are facing a grave economic slowdown  and this is likely to lead to fewer United States made</p><p>products being purchased there.</p><p>This could cause a slowdown in jobs related to auto manufacturing, fast food, and just about anything in</p><p>between. One such example is General Motors. At the present time, the company is seeking ways to</p><p>reduce their exposure to the euro zone. And the European division of McDonalds  the second largest</p><p>region in the firm based on revenue  could also see a drastic slowdown based on Europeans spending</p><p>less on meals out.</p><p>In any case, the fixed income related to these companies  both large and small  can have a big impact</p><p>on the income that investors will see both now and in the future  and those who are invested are likely</p><p>to look for alternatives that will offer them a more steady and comfortable incoming cash flow.</p><p><br></p><p><b>The Bottom Line</b></p><p>While the events that occur overseas may seem worlds away, they can be of great concern right here at</p><p>home. The fact that European institutional investors are expecting the crisis to continue for at least</p><p>another year does little to calm the worries of those in the U.S. and around the globe.</p><p>In some cases, even though the move by the European Central Bank to boost liquidity was a positive sign</p><p> some experts believe that the crisis will continue throughout 2012 and that it will even consist of</p><p>episodes of large and volatile financial swings and that it is unlikely to be resolved without first seeing a</p><p>broad based economic recovery overall.</p><p>This is because, although this liquidity has helped in easing near term pressures of financial institutions,</p><p>banks do not appear to be using it for the types of larger scale purchases of the sovereign debt that they</p><p>should be making  especially that located outside of their own country.</p><p>In addition, similar to with the crisis in the U.S., the liquidity provided by the Central Bank has also not</p><p>helped in ridding the risk of solvency crises. Overall, regardless of the market turmoil, the high yield</p><p>bond asset class could provide longer term investors with good risk adjusted returns  but only if they</p><p>are willing to ride out the storm.</p><p><br></p><p><b>To learn more about the author please visit:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/imranmukati"><b>http://www.linkedin.com/in/imranmukati</b></a></p><p><b>Fairbridge Capital Markets, Inc.</b></p><p><b>Managing Director, Fixed Income Securities</b></p><p><b>(949) 610?7067 Office | (888) 417?3230 Fax | (312) 523?4664 Mobile</b></p><p><b>Email: imukati@fairbridgecap.com</b></p><p><b>Email: imukati1@bloomberg.net</b></p><p><b>2801 West Coast Highway Suite 230</b></p><p><b>Newport Beach, CA 92663</b></p><p><b>Member: FINRA, SIPC, MSRB</b></p>
<p>More than 4,500 Homeless Animals Find Forever Homes</p><p>CARROLLTON, TEXAS (Jan. 8, 2016)Operation Kindness  the original and largest no-kill shelter in North Texas  will begin celebrating their 40th anniversary in 2016, with more than 4,500 homeless animals adopted in 2015 and the highest in the shelters history.</p><p>For the fourth consecutive year, adoption numbers have continued to increase  this year we were able to find homes for 4,519 animals, says Jim Hanophy, CEO of Operation Kindness. Our continued success throughout the years is due to the loyal support of our hardworking volunteers and community partners. Additionally, our corporate and community education programs and annual social events have allowed us to increase awareness of our mission, contributing to our success.</p><p>Adoption numbers continued to grow in 2015 with the introduction of new community programs, including:</p><p>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <b>Foster Talent Agent Training </b> a volunteer foster program designed to provide adoptable animals with a human wingman to find their perfect match.</p><p>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>  Kindness, Inc. </b> a corporate leadership program designed to encourage teamwork, philanthropy and career development in the business sector.</p><p>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Kindness Klubhouse</b>  a satellite adoption center for off-site adoptions of Operation Kindness most precious kittens, puppies, cats and dogs, located at 13394 Preston Road.</p><p>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Happy Tails Society </b>­ dedicated friends provide a monthly gift to help pay for the medical care, medicine, food, shelter, nurturing and behavior training the pets need to have a second chance at life.</p><p>For each animal that is adopted, Operation Kindness is then able to save another animals life. Animals of all sizes, breeds, colors and ages are available for a small adoption fee  which includes vaccinations, worming, testing, microchipping, collar and ID tag. Adoption fees are $135 for cats/kittens and $185 for dogs/puppies.</p><p>Adoption fees also help cover other costs of caring for the animals  food, medicine, tests, spay/neuter surgery, other surgeries, medical procedures, rehabilitation and recovery. This year Operation Kindness performed 5,163 surgeries; 13,169 exams; 1,587 spays and 1,541 neuters; providing more than $83,000 worth of medicine and serving 328,000 meals.</p><p>Operation Kindness is unlike other nonprofits and does not receive funding from the government, instead relying solely on funds from donations, grants and adoption fees to care for homeless animals. As Operation Kindness continues to expand their services to save more lives, their expenses grow as well.</p><p><b>About</b> <b>Operation Kindness</b></p><p>Founded in 1976, Operation Kindness is the original and largest no-kill shelter in North Texas.<b> </b>Its mission is to care for homeless cats and dogs in a no-kill environment until each is adopted into responsible homes and to advocate humane values and behavior. Operation Kindness has saved nearly 80,000 animals since its inception. The shelter assists more than 5,000 dogs and cats each year, caring for an average of 300 animals daily with another 100-150 animals in foster homes.</p><p>Join Operation Kindness in their mission to care for homeless animals by becoming a member of the Happy Tails Society. This group of dedicated friends provides a monthly gift to help pay for the medical care, medicine, food, shelter, nurturing and behavior training the pets need to have a second chance at life.

The coaching services will be available at three national and one global center of the Institute. The trained and skilled study abroad experts here state that the number of Indian students going abroad for foreign studies have significantly improved in the last few decades. This is indeed encouraging as students are exposed to an international career early in life. However, many potential students lack the necessary speaking, writing, reading and listening skills in English- a mandate in most foreign abroad study locations. This is the reason why Study Smart and its team of experienced IELTS and PTE trainers have come forth to help students pass these examinations without tensions.</p>  <p>Students can enroll for these personalized sessions with immediate effect. The skilled trainers will work with them one to one to improve their speaking, listening, reading and writing skills. Both the IELTS and PTE Examinations are difficult to pass without instructed guidance. The trainers at Study Smart also give the students tips on how to score high in their examinations. The rules and the regulations of the test will also be taught to students so that they do not make mistakes out of ignorance. </p>  <p>The classroom batch is small so that trainers are able to devote more time and attention to their students. Both the IELTS and <b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.studysmart.co.in/PTEtest/">PTE training in Delhi</a></b> modules have been uniquely designed by the experts themselves to enable students become confident before appearing for the examinations. Both the IELTS and PTE Examinations are tests of English proficiency that is mandatory to pass for studying or working in nations like UK, New Zealand, Canada and Australia. Students at Study Smart will be exposed to sample tests and mock interviews as well. The onus is to focus on the overall personality development of the student. </p>  <p>The exclusive coaching program formulated by Study Smart is targeted to understand the testing patterns of both these Examinations. Practice makes the students perfect. The coaching classes also include a series of mock tests for students to get used to the examination patterns before they sit for the final tests. </p>  <p>The trainers at Study Smart will also engage the students with audio-visual inputs, personal interactions, initial evaluation and continued assessment so that they can pass the tests with flying colors. </p>  <p>Current students of Study Smart are very happy with the care and guidance given to them by the trained experts here. Most of them say that Study Smart is the best <b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.studysmart.co.in/ielts/">IELTS Institute in Delhi. </a></b>The trainers are friendly and they address student doubts with patience. The Institute has good reviews in Delhi and with the feedback of its current students has decided to go ahead with these personalized coaching batches for both IELTS and PTE Tests. </p>  <p>Admissions are now on for students who are looking for personalized IELTS and PTE training in the Capital. However, limited seats are available. Unlike other PTE and IELTS Institutes in Delhi, Study Smart does not wish to fill up its classrooms with too many students. Phone lines are open for counseling and information on the admission procedures scheduled to open this month. The experts request students to get in touch with them soon for the academic session to begin.</p>  <p>For more details, please contact the office of Study Smart at (9650680072) or visit <a href="http://www.studysmart.co.in">www.studysmart.co.in</a>.</p>  <p>D-62, 3rd Floor, Near Dena Bank, South Extension 1,</p><p>110049 Delhi, India</p>  <p></p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Many a times, litigants have to face a number of hassles unnecessarily even before filing of the suit. They are keen to have been making a number of enquiries from various people getting different views and thus getting confused. We, at our platform seek to remedy all the concern of our clients.

Publishers are leaving billions of dollars on the table by focusing on advertising as their primary revenue source.&nbsp; In reality advertising revenue should be the last channel of revenue they rely on.<br><br>With words like view ability, fill rate and Ad blockers (the really bad word) the advertising eco system has become a mine field with many obstacles to overcome.<br><br>In a July 2014 study by Google the search engine giant determined that the average websites ad view ability is 50.2%.&nbsp; That means half of the average publishers ads are not seen and do not earn any income for the publisher.<br><br>With the steep growth of Programmatic ad buying site specific purchases are becoming rarer for traditional ad units.&nbsp; Advertisers are purchasing audiences using behavioral data and are matching that to the cheapest inventory they can find to cherry pick the best audience for their product.<br><br>So CNN gets a low ball ad buy and the advertiser only buys&nbsp;the ads viewed by the optimal prospects for their products.&nbsp; If a Publisher can attract a premium audience perhaps they can maximize their ad revenue.&nbsp; But even the most premium Publishers (ie: Wall Street Journal, Time Inc., Vogue etc) cannot consistently attract an audience of buyers.<br><br>As the system gets better at maximizing ROI for online advertisers the specific websites will become less and less important to their media planning.&nbsp; At the end of the day the advertisers only care about making sales and, except for illegal or adult sites, dont really care where the buyers come from.<br><br>Where Ecommerce is 300% of Advertising Revenue<br><br>For&nbsp;Thrillist, remnant advertising is non-existent and ads arent sold programmatically. Instead, the digital publisher embraced ecommerce early on and that business is now three times the size of its ad business.<br><br>If todays digital publishers are truly looking to build their business they should begin implementing the most lucrative revenue sources.<br><br>In the first quarter of 2015 Amazon took in $17 billion from merchandise Amazon itself sold to consumers. Of the $17 Billion in sales Amazon kept 33.93% after deducting their cost of goods (the gross margin) so well consider the number of $5.76 Billion. The sales were attained when 569 million unique visitors went to their website.<br><br>During the Q2 2015 the Time Inc network of websites, usually one of the 20 most visited sites in the world, had about 312 million unique visitors and generated about $77 million in advertising revenue.<br><br>Time Inc. generated about $.25 for every unique visitor in the 3 month period while Amazon generated $10.11 for every visitor to their website during their quarter.<br><br>Had Time Inc. been selling products at the same rate as Amazon it would have generated over $3 billion dollars during its quarter. That is 40 times more!<br><br>As for products that publishers can sell looking to their existing operations for opportunities would be the best place to start.&nbsp; For some publishers books could be a good choice.&nbsp; The New York Times is marketing vacations based on editorial/educational themes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Joint ventures with existing ecommerce organizations could also be lucrative.<br><br>Advertising revenue is county specific.&nbsp; Publishers need to solicit different advertisers in each country.&nbsp; Global ad campaigns are rare.&nbsp; Couple that with major market determined International print distribution and the International ad revenue becomes tougher to come by.<br><br>However the same digital subscription can be sold worldwide. Its a much more versatile product. It is sold direct to consumer.<br><br>The Wall Street Journal was one of the earliest traditional newspapers to add online subscriptions and now has about 700,000 digital subscribers, the New York Times recently announced they had exceeded the 1 million digital subscriber level, the Financial Times has over 500,000 and the list goes on.<br><br>Digital subscriptions have the potential to generate much greater profits than print subscriptions once Publishers learn how to optimize their marketing thereby minimizing their subscription acquisition costs.<br><br>The Wall Street Journal is generating $41 million dollars a year based on their $59 annual subscription price.&nbsp; Not the kind of revenue necessary to replace the advertising but it is a good start. Especially considering digital subscriptions can be sold worldwide while print distribution is limited to set geographic areas.<br><br>Probably the most valuable email business, or at least the first most valuable, was Daily Candy.&nbsp; This started out as a deals newsletter for fashionable finds and built into a business that was sold for $125 million dollars to Comcast years later.&nbsp; The entire business was a daily email.<br><br>Email is the digital form of direct marketing and many great fortunes have been made in direct marketing. With millions of visitors daily Publishers are missing out in building out another lucrative revenue source.&nbsp; Publishers could offer paid email subscriptions for super premium content, such as secret hideaway travel newsletter or an investment newsletter, or they could use the free email lists to sell products and services.&nbsp; At a minimum an email list serves as a source of traffic back to the website.<br><br>Lauren Touby built the site MediaBistro.com as a news and information site for the media business.&nbsp; However what most likely started out as a great idea turned into almost 80% of the revenue, a jobs board.&nbsp; Many Publishers see job boards as an add on and do not dedicate any significant resources to the initiative.&nbsp; The job board at MediaBistro earned Lauren $23 million when it was sold in 2007.<br><br>Other revenue sources include resource directories, smartphone applications and software downloads to name a few.<br><br>In the future the most successful publishers will be diversifying away from advertising and some may eliminate advertising entirely.&nbsp; Those same successful publishers will also have recognized that to be successful in ecommerce they need to hire ecommerce experts and to not try to do it themselves.<br><br>Who knows perhaps in 5 years some of the largest ecommerce businesses will be named CNN.com, People.com and the New York Times.

On a fall evening at Fordham University, a class of 30 MBA students was asked, Do you want to eventually work in digital media?<br><br>Thats a huge change from just about four semesters ago, where that number was closer to zero. Most people taking that class called Media Executive Playbook were just doing it as an elective.<br><br>One driver behind the increase: digital media and advertising technology veterans are popping up in classrooms&nbsp; sometimes, even at their own alma maters  to teach them not just the basics of DSPs, DMPs and&nbsp;SSPs but also to stoke an interest in how exciting the world of ad tech and digital media can be.<br><br>One of those is Eric Franchi, founder of Undertone, the guest lecturer that evening at Fordham. Franchi was a guest in&nbsp;Ed Careys class that evening. Carey himself is&nbsp;global vp at Dun &amp; Bradstreet and a former magazine ad sales executive who also worked at ad tech companies including the Rubicon Project and Undertone.<br><br>Franchi chose to focus his lesson&nbsp;on ad networks and ad agencies, and how the lines between tech vendors and agencies are&nbsp;blurring. The class especially responded to his explanation of platform wranglers  employees inside agencies, brands and publishers who&nbsp;liase with new platforms. You folks are in a good position, he told the millennial class. There is a need for this inherent understanding of new platforms that you already have.<br><br>Carey, a Fordham alum, said the interest in careers is on the rise. Other&nbsp;than Franchi, guest speakers in&nbsp;his class have included&nbsp;Jay Sears, svp at The Rubicon Project, and Brian Lesser, global CEO at Xaxis. Theres good academia dedicated to new media adoption out there, but there arent a lot of tenured professors who can actually teach it as a subject matter expert, said Carey.<br><br>Nick Johnson, who left his role as svp national sales at NBC Universal just last month, has for the last few years been working with his alma mater, Gettysburg College, and its office of career development to push digital media as a career. Every fall, he would go into the college to talk about NBC Universal (most kids only at that point knew it as a brand or a TV channel), then check in throughout the year and, in the summer, offer internships inside the company.<br><br>Especially in a liberal arts school, they dont know exactly what NBC does or where they really would fit in, he said. Interns go into ad operations, for example, and have in many cases become full-time employees at the company. Weve built a pipeline.<br><br>The issue for many in the industry is&nbsp;that schools dont necessarily prepare students for real-life jobs. The problem I am trying to solve for is how to matchmake academic institutions and people in our industry hiring at the entry level, said Johnson.<br><br>For one, few people understand how&nbsp;digital media or ad tech works. Secondly, the process can be off-cycle  people graduate in the spring and digital organizations work in a calendar year and rarely have well-established internship programs.<br><br>Greg Coleman, BuzzFeed president and former president of ad tech firm Criteo, has been teaching a class at NYUs Stern School of Business called digital media innovation. Every week, Coleman invites his friends, including Rent the Runway founder Jennifer Hyman or BuzzFeed founder Jonah Peretti to guest lecture, and 75 percent of students grades are decided based on a final media project judged by VCs.<br><br>Coleman was first moved to teach&nbsp;when his daughter began college at Georgetown&nbsp;and he found the digital curriculum extremely light. Things are different now, but he said his focus is to give students a better, real-life view of the digital media world.<br><br>Colemans impetus is common: Schools dont really do it on their own, so those in the industry have to. B-schools and universities in general can do more to prep students for a path in modern digital media and ad tech, said Franchi. The pace of change in the space means that course materials that are as little as a few years old are probably obsolete. Thats also why I like guest lecturing, since it gives me an opportunity to help students understand that the ad tech side of the business is a lot more exciting than they may think.
Most people say you should delay taking Social Security to get a bigger benefit. But rather than waiting for a larger monthly check in the future, I think I'd be much better off collecting Social Security as soon as I can and investing the payments. Do you agree? -- Michael P., Chicago  In a word, no.    I understand the appeal of what you propose. Many people want to get their hands on their benefits as soon as possible, fearing (incorrectly) that Social Security will go broke. Others enjoy the sense of control they get from investing those funds instead of passively waiting for a higher payment down the road.   Still, I think coming out ahead with the strategy you're contemplating will be a lot harder, and riskier, than you think. And there are some downsides that may disadvantage you in ways you haven't considered.   Here's an example.   Let's assume you're 62, the earliest age at which you can claim your worker's benefit, and you have the choice of taking $9,000 a year now or $12,000 a year if you wait until age 66, the age at which you will qualify for a full Social Security benefit.   Related: Your 3 biggest Social Security questions answered   In short, you'll take the standard 25% haircut for claiming your benefit at 62 versus your full retirement age of 66. Social Security will increase those benefits for inflation. So, if inflation runs at, say, 2% a year, the $9,000 payment you started receiving at age 62 will have grown to $9,742 by age 66. Had you waited until age 66 to claim benefits, however, you would start with a benefit of $12,989, or $12,000 plus four years of inflation increases.   If you go ahead with your plan to take benefits early, your Social Security payment would be $9,742 at age 66. That's $3,247 less than the $12,989 you would be entitled to had you waited until age 66 to collect. But you'll also have those four years' worth of Social Security payments you invested. Assuming you invested all of those benefits in a broadly diversified 50% stocks-50% bonds portfolio that returned 5% a year, those early payments would be worth $41,918.   So the question is: Are you better off with the lower Social Security payment plus the $41,918, or waiting for the higher payment for life?   One way to answer that question is to see how long that $41,918, plus future investment earnings on it, would last if you withdrew just enough each year so that the withdrawal plus your lower Social Security payment would match the higher full-age benefit.   Ultimate Retirement Guide: Social Security   And if you go through that process -- withdrawing $3,247 the first year at age 66, $3,312 the second, $3,378 the third, etc. -- you would find that your stash of invested early Social Security payments would run out at age 81. You can think of that as the "break-even" age for your strategy.   At that point, you would have nothing left of the payments you invested, and your Social Security payment at 81, $13,111 ($9,000 plus inflation adjustments), would be $4,371 lower than the $17,482 payment ($12,000, plus inflation) you would be getting had you waited until age 66 to collect. And each year, that dollar gap would widen since your inflation increases are applied to a smaller payment.   You can come up with different break-even ages based on different inflation rates and investment returns. The lower inflation is and the higher your investment return, the longer it would take for your invested Social Security payments to run out. If you figure you'll earn a higher return by investing more aggressively, your scheme looks much better.   Problem is, the more investing risk you take, the greater the chance that your Social Security fund may suffer a big setback. And the combination of an investment loss plus the withdrawals from the fund could potentially deplete your Social Security stash faster than a more conservatively invested portfolio.   Related: The smart way to double your nest egg in 10 years   Suffice it to say that unless you're willing to roll the dice, you're probably looking at a break-even age in the early to mid-80s. And even that's not certain. It's possible that even without a market setback, a conservatively invested portfolio might return less than 5% a year.   Of course, if you die before you reach your early- to mid-80s, you could end up collecting more with your strategy than by waiting for the higher full-age benefit. But how likely is that?   Life expectancy for a 65-year-old man is approximately 86 or 87 and a woman is 88 or 89. And roughly half of people live beyond those estimates, many well beyond. Besides, if you're married and you're the higher wage earner, your spouse may be stuck with that lower benefit if she (or he) outlives you. That's another reason many people hold off for a higher benefit.   There are plenty of other ways to crunch these numbers and many other factors you can take into account, such as taxes, which I've left out to simplify things. (I should also note that there's an "escape clause." If you decide to change your mind within 12 months, you can repay benefits and reapply for higher payments later.) But unless you're an incredibly talented or lucky investor or you expect to die early (and your spouse's benefit isn't an issue), you're probably better off just waiting until full-retirement age to collect.   Related: When can I start getting Social Security payouts?   Indeed, you may be able to collect even more over your lifetime by postponing payments to as late as age 70. And if you're married, you may be able to maximize the amount you and your spouse receive by coordinating when you claim benefits.   Given the amount of money involved, I think almost everyone should consult a Social Security calculator before filing for benefits or, if you're not comfortable doing the analysis on your own, consult a service, such as Maximize My Social Security or Social Security Solutions that will lay out your options for a fee.   I'm all for astute investing in retirement, including reasonable ways to take Social Security into account when building a portfolio. But the strategy you're proposing combines little upside potential with lots of downside risk. That's a lousy combo. So I recommend you abandon it.

<p><b>Burlingame, Ca. - January 12, 2016.</b> AlerSense Incorporated has created the worlds first <i>smart</i> airborne allergy and asthma early warning system alerting consumers as particles and toxins build. AlerSense is an in-home unit when, combined with the mobile app, delivers accurate environmental readings, giving asthma and allergy sufferers precious time to remove themselves from, or alter the environment to possibly mitigate or avoid an allergy or asthma attack. AlerSense delivers precise in-home measurements of airborne contamination and toxins such as pollen, mold, dust, dust mite waste, VOCs and animal dander helping consumers monitor the levels of airborne contamination in the environment that can cause allergy and asthma attacks. AlerSense also tracks humidity and temperature thus creating a holistic air quality assessment.</p><p>AlerSense was founded by a team of passionate people who were determined to change the way we look allergies and asthma caused by airborne contaminants. For the longest time we have accepted the fact that allergies and asthma attacks just happen. We wanted to work on a project that would help people throughout the world understand when contaminants are building in the home so that they can make the appropriate adjustments to possibly avoid an allergy or asthma attack, said Skip Sanzeri founder and CEO of AlerSense. Weve combined some of the worlds most advanced sensors, with a smart mobile app and extensive software algorithms that will allow users to record allergy and asthma symptoms at the time when they first noticed the symptoms. Our goal is to give consumers enough time to avoid or mitigate an allergy or asthma attack. And the system gets smarter as it learns each family members sensitivities based on user input. Airborne contaminants are usually invisible to the naked eye and therefore attack unannounced. Well, were here to make the announcement.</p><p>AlerSense units will be available in the spring of 2016. Interested customers may preorder AlerSense via the AlerSense website at <a href="http://www.alersense.com/">www.AlerSense.com</a>. </p><p><b>Global Problems</b></p><p>The global allergy diagnostic and treatment market is projected to increase to nearly $35.3 billion by 2015 from $31.5 billion in 2014. According to the U. S. Center for Disease Control (CDC), it is estimated that 1 in 12 Americans has asthma. Additionally the CDC estimates that 17.6 million Americans were diagnosed with hay fever in the past 12 months. </p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>About AlerSense</b></p><p>AlerSense stands for Aler (Alert, Allergy), and Sense (detect and report).

Tuesday night at Target Center, playing the team whose path to the upper echelon of the Western Conference they are hoping to retrace, the Timberwolves got another difficult reminder of just how long that path is.<br><br>On the front end of a back-to-back that will take them to Houston on Wednesday, finishing up an 0-for-4 homestand, the Wolves late really came up short in a 101-96 loss to Oklahoma City.<br><br>The familiar one-two-punch of Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant led the way as the Thunder beat the Wolves for the eighth straight time. Durant scored 30 points with seven rebounds and three assists. Westbrook, who nearly had a double-double by halftime, finished with 22 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds.<br><br>It is the Thunder, perhaps more than any other team, that the Wolves are trying to emulate. Flip Saunders often voiced his admiration of the way the Thunder  which drafted Durant in 2007 and Westbrook and Serge Ibaka in 2008  was built. The hope was that Andrew Wiggins, Karl-Anthony Towns and Zach LaVine would become the same kind of cornerstones.<br><br>Tuesday morning after the Thunders shootaround, Durant spoke highly of the way the Wolves were trying to build their team, saying they were doing it the right way. But, he said, its a tough process to go through; the Thunder won 20 games in Durants rookie season, 23 a year later with Westbrook and Ibaka before breaking through with 50 a year later.<br><br>The Wolves (12-27) continue to learn that. They lost for the seventh straight time and for the 11th time in 12 games.<br><br>But not without a fight. The Wolves were down 14 entering the fourth quarter when LaVine and Shabazz Muhammad led a charge that brought the Wolves within three points on Wiggins put-back dunk with 3:14 left.<br><br>Durant hit a 20-footer, but Wiggins followed with a layup. Durant hit again, then Wiggins made one of two free throws. But Durant scored again, with 1:15 left, to put the Thunder up six.<br><br>Continuing to bring energy off the bench, Muhammad scored 20 points. LaVine, who has battled a shooting slump, scored 21 points with nine rebounds; it was those two players who led the Wolves back in the fourth quarter. Wiggins scored 22 and Towns had 12.<br><br>The Wolves were down 13 before the game was 5 minutes old. They were down 11 after a quarter, 12 at the half and 14 entering the third before the Wolves rallied to make it a game.<br><br>Some late-arriving fans hadnt even reached their seats by the time the Thunder opened the game on a 15-2 run. The Wolves settled for  and missed  jumpers early while the Thunder moved the ball for easier shots. Thats why four of five Thunder starters scored in that 15-2 start.<br><br>But the Wolves found some energy when LaVine and Muhammad entered the game, pulling within eight late in the quarter before Oklahoma City  with Durant getting a three-point play and a three-pointer  closed the quarter strong to take an 11-point lead into the second quarter.<br><br>The Wolves bench  particularly LaVine and Muhammad  continued to click in the second. Muhammad, who scored 10 second-quarter points, hit two free throws to pull the Wolves within seven points. But two Durant jumpers sandwiched an Ibaka three-pointer and the Thunder was back up 14. Up nine late, Westbrooks three-pointer at the halftime buzzer gave Oklahoma City a 60-48 halftime lead.<br><br>Despite cutting down on the turnovers and getting nine points from Wiggins in the third quarter, the Wolves were unable to make up any ground in the third quarter. With Westbrook scoring nine points and Durant seven, the Thunder pushed the lead to 14 entering the fourth quarter.

<p> <b>January </b><b>13</b><b>, 2016 </b> When you start to get into shape, one of the best machines that you can use is a treadmill. However, there are plenty of options and you don't always need to purchase an expensive one to get the most out of it, but instead there are plenty that are inexpensive options as well. Simply determine which features of the machine you want or need and look at the machines with those options and find the best one for your budget. You should also make sure that you are looking at every element and not just the budget, but look at how you plan to use it as well.</p><p><i><b>Choosing the Right One Based on Requirements</b></i><br></p><p>If you are looking for a machine that isn't extremely expensive, then  make sure to look at the <b><a href="http://treadmill-ratings-reviews.com/treadmill-reviews/budget-treadmills/horizon-fitness-t101-4/" target="_blank">Horizon Treadmill T101</a></b>. However, there are a few things that you should look into, including what features you can do without and which ones you need. There are plenty that you can look for, including heart rate monitor, calories burned and other ones that are standard, however, there are some additional ones that you can find. These ones, which aren't necessarily required, include the book stand, television and other non-crucial items.<br></p><p><i><b>Usage of Treadmill</b></i><br></p><p>Another thing that you need to think about before you check out the <b>nordictrack x9i incline trainer reviews</b> is how often you will be using the machine and for what. If you are simply going to use it for walking, then you can get away with a machine that is in the much lower price bracket, while if you are going to be jogging, then you should aim for the middle priced ones. However, if you are planning to run full out on the machine, then you should look at the top end ones that would ensure that you have the best of everything.<br></p><p>All of these are crucial when it comes to purchasing the proper machine for your workouts, so don't forget to look at all aspects. You need to determine your budget and how much you can afford to spend on the machine and what you will be using it for since each one is used for specific needs. Don't think that you need to spend a lot of money on a machine if you are just going to be walking or even jogging when the more basic machines will work just fine.<br></p><p><b>Website: <a href="http://treadmill-ratings-reviews.com" title="Link: http://treadmill-ratings-reviews.com">http://treadmill-ratings-reviews.com</a></b></p><p><br></p>

While many enterprises have voiced their concern over quality of reports and the price being quoted by major companies, ResearchFox has been successful in gaining attention of global audiences with their low-price-high-quality research reports.</p><p><b><u>Keep a Tab on Technology Markets without Burning your Wallet</u></b></p><p>Companies are often driven with the need to diversify, to expand and to know more about the competition. ResearchFox offers all of this under one roof named as ResearchCafe - digital delivery platform for reports. One of the major reasons for syndicated research to witness questionable enquiries has been the hierarchical follow up required to buy expensive reports, especially in an enterprise-level firm. Priced nominally, ResearchFox believes anyone across the hierarchy can buy their reports and utilize the information for their betterment. Emerging technologies have always been exciting prospects to know more, however, when investing in these technologies, it is imperative to gain firsthand knowledge. Accessibility to information quickly will increase the possibility of an expedited decision making process and provide much needed relief to the entire value chain. </p><p>With a present portfolio of 800+ reports across 10 technology segments and major industry verticals, the subscription model will only add to a companys repository and serve as a one-stop solution for quick and easy access. Understanding technology at finger tips is one of the mantras of ResearchFox and expects to deliver the same by adding features more frequently than ever before. Present features include the likes of customized PDF download, interactive competitive intelligence and subscription based pricing. A quick update mechanism is in place for any data revisits that will happen over a period of time. </p><p>We understand the value of information and the grind that employees undergo seeking approval in buying a research report. Heavily priced reports are always a bane to information seekers in the industry. We, at ResearchFox are trying to help employees at all levels in the hierarchy by offering reports which can be bought immediately out of ones pocket without the need for approval. Says Pranab Sen, Partner at ResearchFox Consulting. He continued stating built on the concepts of machine learning and big data, ResearchCafe offers an intuitive yet seamless report delivery experience.</p><p>Research team at the company validated the point that companies are looking for cost-effective report consumption solutions for faster decision making.</p><p>Having served the technology industry for more than 10 years as Han Digital Group of Companies, ResearchFox has been instrumental in offering niche services across all stages of industry ecosystem. Startups have benefitted with the expertise provided in helping develop investor pitches and ResearchCafe acts as a helping hand in learning about emerging markets firsthand. Other research services include idea testing, customer acceptance studies and many more.</p><p><b><u>About ResearchFox</u></b></p><p>ResearchFox is an International market research company from Bangalore, India with focus on delivering high quality research services to business professionals, organizations and individuals through knowledge driven research methodology.

<p>In a bid to ensure that no one is without a date this Valentines, luxury dating app Luxy (<a href="http://www.onluxy.com">www.onluxy.com</a>), is holding its first Millionaire Dating Auction. </p><p><br></p><p>Since launching in 2014, Luxy has witnessed more than 500K downloads in less than six months, has matched more than one billion singles and has a few marriage success stories under its designer belt too. Now this Valentines, our source tell us that Luxy is starting its very first Millionaire Dating Auction, allowing non-Luxy members to bid to date a Luxy elite. But as an app that caters to the worlds top 1% and requires users to earn north of $200k, bidders will be digging deep into their pockets to date one of these high flyers.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Whats the difference between Luxys Millionaire Dating Auction and getting an escort? This isnt about sex, said our source, who wishes to remain anonymous, Luxy users are Successful and Attractive, theyre who you wish you could date. Unfortunately though, if you dont make the cut to get membership, dating someone with Luxy calibre is unlikely, until now.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Luxy plans to hold an auction where its users are willing to go on a date with someone outside the app, whether they meet the Luxy standards, or not. Luxy wants to open its doors to the world. If you can afford a date with one of the most beautiful people on the planet - youre in our source said.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The starting bid has not been formally revealed yet but our source informed us that its $10k. Luxy users get to decide how much theyre willing to accept to go on the date, but its a $10k minimum. Despite wanting to reach more of the population, this auction is only for those who have at least six figures in their bank account.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Bids have been placed already. The auction hasnt started yet but people are so desperate to go on a decent date, Luxy has already received bids from non-Luxy members. Thats what sparked the whole idea, said our source.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Although taking part in this dating auction increases the likelihood of going on a Luxy date, the bidder only gets to date one Luxy member. If more dates are desired, it might be worth hedging your bets and sign up to Luxy.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>For more information visit <a href="http://www.onluxy.com">www.onluxy.com</a>.</p><p><br></p><p><b>About Luxy Inc.:</b></p><p>Luxy® is rated the fastest-growing luxury online millionaires club in the matchmaker marketplace.&nbsp; Among numerous others the luxury dating site has been featured on CNN, ABC, CNBC, CBS, The Huffington Post, Business Insider and The New York Times.

<p><b>TORONTO, Jan. 14, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE)</b> &nbsp;Intellipharmaceutics International Inc. (<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ipci">IPCI</a>) (TSX:I) (Intellipharmaceutics or the Company), a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research, development and manufacture of novel and generic controlled-release and targeted-release oral solid dosage drugs, today announced that pivotal bioequivalence trials of the Companys Rexista Oxycodone XR (abuse deterrent oxycodone hydrochloride) extended release tablets, dosed under fasted and fed conditions, had demonstrated bioequivalence to Oxycontin® (oxycodone hydrochloride) extended release tablets as manufactured and sold in the United States by Purdue Pharma LP. The study design was based on United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations and compared the lowest and highest strengths of exhibit batches of the Companys Rexista Oxycodone XR to the same strengths of Oxycontin®. The results show that the ratios of the pharmacokinetic metrics, Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-f &nbsp;for Rexista vs. Oxycontin®, are within the interval of 80%  125% required by the FDA with a confidence level exceeding 90%.</p><p>The Company had earlier announced, in March 2015, that topline data results of three definitive Phase I pharmacokinetic clinical trials (single dose fasting, single dose steady-state fasting, and single dose fed), conducted on pilot batches of the Companys Rexista Oxycodone XR, all met the FDA bioequivalence criteria when compared to the existing branded drug Oxycontin®.</p><p>The Company had also earlier announced, in May 2015, that the FDA had provided the Company with notification regarding its Investigational New Drug Application (IND) submission for Rexista Oxycodone XR. &nbsp;The notification from the FDA had stated that the Company would not be required to conduct Phase III studies if bioequivalence to Oxycontin® was demonstrated.</p><p>Having now demonstrated such bioequivalence for its Rexista Oxycodone XR product to be marketed upon FDA approval, the Company intends to complete the regulatory filing requirements and file a New Drug Application (NDA) for Rexista Oxycodone XR with the FDA within the next 6 months in accordance with the NDA 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway.  There can be no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve the NDA for the sale of Rexista Oxycodone XR in the U.S. market, or that it will ever be successfully commercialized.</p><p>We take great pride in being the first pharmaceutical company, to the best of our knowledge, to have demonstrated bioequivalence in both fasted and fed conditions to the brand reference drug Oxycontin®. &nbsp;This enables us to accelerate the development and commercialization of our abuse deterrent Rexista Oxycodone XR product candidate without the need for costly and time-consuming Phase III efficacy trials,&nbsp;stated Dr. Isa Odidi, CEO and co-founder of Intellipharmaceutics. We look forward to filing an NDA within the next six months, which we hope will lead to a positive contribution in addressing an unmet need in opioid abuse and addiction. </p><p><b>Rexista Oxycodone XR</b></p><div></div><p>Rexista Oxycodone XR is the Companys non-generic extended release formulation intended for the management of moderate to severe pain when an around-the-clock analgesic is required. The formulation is intended to present a significant barrier to tampering when subjected to various forms of anticipated physical and chemical manipulation commonly used by abusers. It is also designed to prevent dose dumping when inadvertently or intentionally co-administered with alcohol. In addition, when crushed or pulverized and hydrated, the proposed extended release formulation is designed to coagulate instantaneously and entrap the drug in a viscous hydrogel, which is intended to prevent syringing, injecting or snorting.</p><p><b>About Intellipharmaceutics</b></p><p>Intellipharmaceutics International Inc. is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research, development and manufacture of novel and generic controlled-release and targeted-release oral solid dosage drugs. The Companys patented Hypermatrix technology is a multidimensional controlled-release drug delivery platform that can be applied to the efficient development of a wide range of existing and new pharmaceuticals. Based on this technology platform, Intellipharmaceutics has developed several drug delivery systems and a pipeline of products (our dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules for the 15 and 30 mg strengths which received final FDA approval) and product candidates in various stages of development, including Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs ) filed with the FDA (and one Abbreviated New Drug Submission (ANDS)  filed with Health Canada) in therapeutic areas that include neurology, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal tract, diabetes and pain.</p><p>Intellipharmaceutics also has NDA 505(b)(2) specialty drug product candidates in its development pipeline. These include Rexista Oxycodone XR, an abuse deterrent oxycodone based on its proprietary nPODDDS novel Point Of Divergence Drug Delivery System and PODRAS Paradoxical OverDose Resistance Activating System, and Regabatin XR pregabalin extended-release capsules. Our current development effort is increasingly directed towards improved difficult-to-develop controlled-release drugs which follow an NDA 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. The Company has increased its research and development emphasis towards new product development, facilitated by the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, by advancing the product development program for both Rexista and Regabatin.  The 505(b)(2) pathway (which relies in part upon the approving agencys findings for a previously approved drug) both accelerates development timelines and reduces costs in comparison to NDAs for new chemical entities. An advantage of our strategy for development of NDA 505(b)(2) drugs is that our product candidates can, if approved for sale by the FDA, potentially enjoy an exclusivity period which may provide for greater commercial opportunity relative to the generic ANDA route.</p><p>Certain statements in this document constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and/or forward-looking information under the Securities Act (Ontario).

<p>Online reviews have become a mainstay of most major retail websites; its increasingly rare for a site not to provide people with the opportunity to rate whatever theyre selling. From a consumer perspective, the benefits of user reviews are fairly clear; they give us an insight into how well a product works or how badly it doesnt work, from those who have already taken the plunge and spent their money on it. And while it may seem rather crazy to trust the opinions of people we dont know (Jayson DeMers goes so far as to label it <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysondemers/2015/12/28/how-important-are-customer-reviews-for-online-marketing/">astounding</a>), theres no doubt that, when choosing between two similar products, most of us would be inclined to choose the one that has garnered a greater number of positive reviews.</p><p>Genuine reviews by real people also offer a sense of trustworthiness to your website. Even if the reviews are not all positive (more on that later), your users will feel more comfortable buying from you if they know that real people have tried your product, and that they can draw upon the opinions of those people.</p><p>What about the SEO benefits of user reviews? There are two in particular that merit closer examination. First and foremost, allowing users to write content about your products is a free and easy way to add fresh, diverse, and keyword-rich content to your site (and as we know, Google is a big fan of fresh, diverse, and keyword-rich content).</p><p>Secondly, user review content offers a firsthand glimpse into the needs and requirements of your target demographic  as well as the ways in which the members of that demographic try to fulfill those needs. How often have you read a review that starts with the phrase, I have been looking all over for an [x] that does [y]? The chances are good that that particular person typed a similar phrase into Google as part of his or her quest to find said product. With user reviews, you allow your audience to define what theyre searching for, in their own words; you can then tailor your content accordingly, so that your site ranks more successfully.</p><p>Maybe youre dragging your feet on including user reviews because youre worried about negative feedback. If thats the case, consider this: negative feedback has been shown to&nbsp;<a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/9366-ecommerce-consumer-reviews-why-you-need-them-and-how-to-use-them/">aid in conversions</a>&nbsp;as well. This is, in part, because users who are serious about buying something want to educate themselves fully about a product  and that means learning and understanding the bad as well as the good. (Some sites, including TripAdvisor, give retailers the opportunity to respond to reviews; the TripAdvisor model differs from that of the standard retail site, however.) And if nothing else, negative reviews provide you with suggestions for improvement  which in turn can be spun into your ever-evolving SEO strategy.</p><p>Web content has come a long way. Fast forward to 2016, and&nbsp;quality&nbsp;content is king.&nbsp;<a href="http://galileotechmedia.com/6-reasons-why-wise-content-is-smarter-than-the-rest/">Wise Content</a>&nbsp;serves as a customer service engine, answering the questions and concerns your audience shares via user reviews, says Joseph McElroy, CEO of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.galileotechmedia.com/">GalileoTechMedia.com</a>.</p><p>Wise Content serves social media by being research rich, opinion forming, and most of all - SHARABLE. Content must understand the mind of the reader and change dynamically to meet expectations and answer questions.</p>

<p>Horsham, PA  January 18, 2016  Cottman Transmissions and Total Auto Care is pleased to announce that Sue Burg, senior director of advertising, has joined the Car Care Council Womens Board. </p><p>The Womens Board is dedicated to providing support for women working in the auto repair industry. According to their web site  <a href="http://www.carcare.org/womens-board/" title="Link: http://www.carcare.org/womens-board/">www.carcare.org/womens-board/</a>  the Womens Board offers networking, mentoring, and advisory assistance for female automotive professionals. </p><p>Its not much wonder that these goals would resonate with Burg: Shes been with Cottman for over 30 years, providing marketing support for Cottman and its franchisees. And with that experience, shes no doubt familiar with the pitfalls that women face in whats traditionally been a male-dominated industry. </p><p>The Womens Board is here to make people aware that there are strong, capable women in the auto repair industry, says Burg. Every day, more women are entering this industry as service writers, shop owners, and even technicians. And they need encouragement and assistance from the women whove opened the doors and led the way for them. </p><p>Earlier this year, at the AAPEX 2015 show in Las Vegas, the Car Care Council Womens Board honored Cottman for its Cottman Man blog  thecottmanmanblog.com  an online site where Cottman provides consumers with auto care and repair advice in a friendly, easy-to-follow manner. While not specifically written for women, the blog is designed to be accessible and informative to all consumers, regardless of gender or automotive familiarity. </p><p>Cottman President Randy Wright had this to say about Burgs step to help women in the automotive industry: Were all very proud of Sue and inspired by her efforts on behalf of women in the auto repair industry. More and more repair decisions are being made by women, so it can only help improve our image and our ability to serve them to have women as part of the repair effort. </p><p>The entire staff at the Cottman home office would like to thank Burg for her dedication and to offer her any assistance she needs in her efforts to help women take their rightful place in the auto repair industry<br></p><p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/robin8-production/robin8-production/7df62972-1172-464a-9be2-e9cb4900b150/SueBurg.jpg" title="Image: http://s3.amazonaws.com/robin8-production/robin8-production/7df62972-1172-464a-9be2-e9cb4900b150/SueBurg.jpg"><br></p><p><b>About Cottman Transmission and Total Auto Care: </b></p><p>With locations across the U.S., Cottman Transmission and Total Auto Care is a transmission and auto repair brand that services almost any make or model vehicle, foreign or domestic.

<p>[January 5, 2016 - Sarasota, Florida] &nbsp;Daily exposures as common as stress, diet, and the environment can affect skin aging, possibly by affecting billions of health-promoting bacteria that normally live on our skin, called the skin microbiome.  Additional research shows that maintaining a well-balanced skin microbiome with a daily dose of topical probiotics applied to the skin may be just as important as oral probiotics for a healthy GI tract.<br></p><p>How do skin probiotics work?  The tiny molecular messages packaged into probiotics fit skin cells like a lock-and-key, and send skin-balancing messages to help the skin to look younger, improve its hydration, and stimulate the skin immune system.  However, if the right amount and type of these tiny bacterial signals are not present, an out-of-balance skin microbiome can result. Research shows that an imbalanced skin microbiome is associated with, and may even promote, skin conditions such as eczema, acne, and rosacea, as well as skin aging.  Common skin exposure such as soaps, environmental toxins and irritants, and even many skin care products can damage the skin microbiome.  For these reasons, skin with its billions of bacterial friends deserves daily probiotic support, just like your GI tract.</p><p>&nbsp;What does skin on probiotics look like?  Well, it depends on the quality of the probiotic.  The vast majority of probiotics are taken from animals, food or soil.  These probiotics -- called xenobiotics -- are not native to the human body.  BioEsse® Probiotic Essence for the Skin is the only skin care system containing patent-pending, concentrated BellaCell®, a probiotic sourced from the human microbiome, and which therefore naturally belongs on the human body.  BellaCell® and the skin care system BioEsse® &nbsp;(facial cleanser, serum, lotion, and eye cream) were discovered and developed at Quorum Innovations (Sarasota, FL). &nbsp;</p><p> <br> </p><p>                                   </p><p>BioEsse® clinical tests show results in 2 weeks, with improved skin texture, more even complexion and less facial redness, decreased fine lines, wrinkles and pores, improved skin hydration, and frequently, a new-found skin "glow" reported by many BioEsse® consumers.  BioEsse® Probiotic Essence for the Skin contains dermatologist-recommended topical probiotics, which promote healthy skin bacteria.  The BioEsse® line is an eco-luxe, "green" skin care line, containing only 100% naturally-derived, pure ingredients, minus the heavy, toxic preservatives, chemicals and synthetic ingredients that can damage skin and overall health.  BioEsse® is all about the probiotic technology, comment Dr. Nicholas Monsul, and Dr. Eva Berkes, clinical physicians and co-founders of Quorum Innovations.</p>

Kraft</i> was certified for publication, and is now case law.&nbsp; The Opinion makes it illegal for a tenant to rent a room in their apartment, even if the tenant obtains written permission from the landlord to do so, if the court finds such an act may violate a zoning ordinance without the Zoning Administrations determination.</p>  <p>Notable in the case, Chens attorneys Request to Certify Opinion for Publication, states: <i>Chen applies existing law to a novel set of facts and involves an issue of burgeoning public interest, specifically stating, Interest groups seeking to amend the zoning code, should first have a definitive statement from the courts on what the city law is, before city law can be amended</i>. If the city isnt sure what exactly the law is, and the zoning administration is absent from the court decision, and there are no complaints from anyone other than the landlord who doesnt live at the premises, how would the tenant know she was in in violation?&nbsp; The opinion not only defies common sense; it violates the constitutional rights of the <i>in pro per</i> tenant in the case.&nbsp; And while it may have created law, how would anyone know what exactly the law was and how it applied to this type of use, before the Opinion was published? &nbsp;</p>  <p>The Opinion states that the defendant was operating a bed and facility and/or transient occupancy residential structure and the defendants use of the premises in this manner was illegal and in violation of LAMC 12.08 and 12.21.&nbsp; The Plaintiffs evidence of this violation consisted of her own declaration, a copy of the propertys parcel report generated from the Citys Zone Information Map Access System online and </p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Page 2-2-2-2</p>  <p>a copy of the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety Property profile report also generated online.&nbsp; Both indicated the property to be located in the R1-1 zone. </p>  <p><i>Chen v Kraft</i> may not state all the facts, and as it is written, it may appear the tenant had rented her entire unit, when in fact, she did not.&nbsp; The buildings certificate of occupancy and the fact that the building </p>  <p>itself is an apartment house are omitted.&nbsp; No case law existed nor any statutory law forbidding the sharing of ones home by listing spare rooms on a third party platform such as Airbnb, and this Opinion changes all that. &nbsp;Does Los Angeles need any more loopholes to illegal evict tenants? </p>  <p>Airbnb has had a positive impact for many communities of which have been discussed in the media as well as thru the public participation in the city council hearings.&nbsp; The benefits of finding a temporary place to stay while a home is being remodeled, when taking a new job in a new city or to escape an abusive husband should not be overlooked.&nbsp; The taxes paid for transient occupancy is a viable source of income for the city.</p>  <p>In <i>Chen v. Kraft</i> (2016) a summary proceeding, (a motion for summary judgement), within a summary proceeding (an unlawful detainer action) the eviction was effectuated strictly on the landlords accusation of the violation without any city involvement. And without any complaints from anyone other than the landlord.&nbsp; The building was sold at the end of 2012, in a real estate transaction that was hidden from the tenants and to which one sales agent, Ian Brooks, represented both the seller and the buyers.&nbsp; </p>  <p>New owner, Louise Chen, a white collar criminal defense attorney at O'Melveny &amp; Myers along with her husband/apartment manager/UCLA Medical School Professor, Paul Wimmers, failed in their first efforts to evict the tenant by refusing her rent payments then filing an unlawful detainer action for non-payment of rent.&nbsp; After voluntarily dismissing the first action, Chen then hired Santa Monica Attorney Rosario Perry.&nbsp; Perry was able to help the couple succeed in the eviction of the tenant under the Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance allowable evictions, using the premises for any illegal purpose (L.A.M.C. 151.09 (a) (4)).</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Page 3-3-3-3</p>  <p>The July 13, 2016 <i>Chen v. Kraft</i> Opinion states in part: <i>With respect to the operation of a bed and breakfast or transient occupancy in the premises, plaintiff submitted evidence, inter alia, in the form of testimony from defendants deposition wherein she stated as follows: [Question:] And so would it be correct to say  accurate to say that from the time  at least from the time of January 22nd, 2014 through today [May 7, 2014], you were running Airbnb business from your apartment? [¶] [Defendant:] I would say Im listing  I have listings on Airbnb that  yes, running today. [¶] [Question:] So the answer is youre running  its an Airbnb business, isnt it? [¶] [Defendant:] Yes. [¶] [Question:] And you continue to do it through today. [¶] [Defendant:] Yes. In addition to the above, plaintiff also submitted a City of Los Angeles Tax Registration Certificate issued January 6, 2014, indicating payment of a Transient Occupancy Tax with respect to the premises. Accordingly, plaintiff met her initial burden on the motion. </i></p>  <p>The Opinion continues; <i>In her opposition, defendant presented evidence in the form of the 2009 Addendum wherein plaintiffs predecessor in interest expressly agreed, in writing, to allow defendant to engage in the Airbnb activities at issue. However, any purported consent by the prior landlord is not dispositive. This is because the Addendum constituted an illegal contract in violation of existing regulations, and was therefore void and unenforceable. (See Civ. Code, § 1598 [generally, if object of contract is unlawful, then entire contract is void]; Shephard v.

Kraft</i> was certified for publication, and is now case law.  The Opinion makes it illegal for a tenant to rent a room in their apartment, even if the tenant obtains written permission from the landlord to do so, if the court finds such an act may violate a zoning ordinance without the Zoning Administrations determination.</p>  <p>The Request to Certify Opinion for Publication included the following statement; <i>Chen</i> applies existing law to a novel set of facts and involves an issue of burgeoning public interest, specifically stating, Interest groups seeking to amend the zoning code, should first have a definitive statement from the courts on what the city law <i>is</i>, before city law can be amended.</p>  <p><i>Chen v. Kraft</i> (2016) was a summary proceeding, (a motion for summary judgment), within a summary proceeding (an unlawful detainer action) and the eviction was effectuated strictly on the landlords accusation of the violation and reference to various codes within the Los Angeles Municipal Code.  There was no city involvement in the determination of the zoning violation. </p>  <p>The Plaintiff and Respondent, Chen, retained the services of Santa Monica attorney, Rosario Perry, successfully evicting the tenant under the Los Angeles Municipal Code Section 151.09 (a) (4) using the premises for any illegal purpose (L.A.M.C. 151.09 (a) (4)).</p>  <p>And although, the building itself is not specified in the Opinion, the premises at issue is a four-unit apartment house.  The tenant and defendant, Joelle Kraft admitting to renting rooms in her apartment via the third party Internet platform, Airbnb.com.  Appellate and defendant believed her use was not in violation of any laws.</p>  <p>The Appellate Division, however, affirmed the lower courts decision, that the defendant was operating a bed and facility and/or transient occupancy residential structure and the defendants use of the premises in this manner was illegal and in violation of LAMC 12.08 and 12.21. </p>  <p>The Plaintiffs evidence of this violation consisted of her own declaration, a copy of the propertys parcel report generated online from the Citys Zone Information Map Access System and a Property Profile report generated from the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety website.  Both indicated the property to be located in an R1-1, single-family zone.</p>  <p>The Opinion states; <i>With respect to the operation of a bed and breakfast or transient occupancy in the premises, plaintiff submitted evidence, inter alia, in the form of testimony from defendants deposition wherein she stated as follows: [Question:] And so would it be correct to say  accurate to say that from the time  at least from the time of January 22nd, 2014 through today [May 7, 2014], you were running Airbnb business from your apartment? [¶] [Defendant:] I would say Im listing  I have listings on Airbnb that  yes, running today. [¶] [Question:] So the answer is youre running  its an Airbnb business, isnt it? [¶] [Defendant:] Yes.</i></p>  <p>&nbsp;In addition to the plaintiff also submitted a City of Los Angeles Tax Registration Certificate issued to the defendant indicating payment of a Transient Occupancy Tax with respect to the premises. Based on this evidence, the Appellate court found the plaintiff had therefore met her initial burden on the motion.</p>  <p>In opposition, defendant presented a 2009 rental lease addendum signed by Chen's predecessor in interest, allowing the tenant to list her rooms on the Airbnb website and host guests from the website, without violating the existing rental agreement.  The Appellate Division found the consent of the landlord constituted an illegal contract and was therefore void and unenforceable. </p>  <p><i>Chen v.

<p>GoXercise, Inc. is launching the Patented (20-in-1) Trans4mer portable fitness device with its Crowdfunding Campaign on Kickstarter.com today. The flexible Trans4mer combines all the benefits of exercising with (20) individual pieces of hand-held fitness equipment in this (1) convenient multi-purpose device, like the Swiss Army Knife of fitness equipment.</p><p>Gary Shorter, the inventor, suffered from Lower Back Pain that afflicts 31 Million Americans (1). His sciatic pain was so severe he required surgery to fuse his L4-L5 vertebrae to relieve the pain. After months in a back brace and weeks of physical therapy he realized that light weights with non-extreme exercise worked best to strengthen his core. But doctors sent him home with just a yoga mat and stretch band to continue exercising when he recognized a need for better equipment. Using his engineering skills, he combined the Russian nesting doll concept with the variety of hand-held fitness equipment he used at physical therapy and invented the multi-functional all-in-one Trans4mer.</p><p></p><blockquote>Lower Back Pain is too common and strengthening the core is a well known solution for relief, but there isnt convenient equipment and non-extreme exercise training for home users. The focus today is too extreme and too heavy for back pain sufferers, said Gary Shorter, President of GoXercise, Inc. Just walk and swing the Trans4mer will exercise the neglected upper body, double the calorie burn and strengthen your core because of your bodys natural balance while you walk, said Shorter.&nbsp;</blockquote><p></p><p>The Trans4mer Model-10 weighs just (10) pounds and saves (115) pounds of our natural resources used on the (20) individual pieces of fitness equipment it replaces.

In the aftermath of the North American International Auto Show (NAIAS), Luxy reveals the first-date-car-of-choice as voted by the Millionaire crowd. And as always, men and women couldnt agree less.</p><p>Since launching in 2014, the Luxy dating app has witnessed more than 500K downloads in less than six months. During this time, thousands of people have identified their luxury brand preferences on their dating profiles  and Luxy has compiled and ranked those luxury brands preferred by our wealthy single members. Ahead of the Apple Watch 2 release, Luxy recently found a strong preference amongst the elite 1% for classic watches (read: Rolex) as opposed to Apples wearable toy.&nbsp;</p><p>For over a century, the first month of the year has played host to the worlds most prestigious auto show. The NAIAS introduces the coolest cars and dynamic designs for 2016. This year luxury car brands Lexus, BMW and Audi all reveal their newest E models, hoping to take a position in the high-end EV market. Luxury car manufacturers also showcased their new E-mobility at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) earlier this year.&nbsp;</p><p>To no surprise, Luxy finds that German brands come on top. Millionaires prefer BMW (45,874 votes) the most, followed by Audi (42,470) and Mercedes-Benz (36,216). Tesla scored 7,350, suggesting that the high-end EV market has some work to do when it comes to winning round the luxury market.</p><p>But what about cars and dating?</p><p>Men were asked, Which car are you most likely to drive when you pick up your lady on a first date?, where women were asked, which car would you prefer your man to drive on a first date?. Results conflicted.&nbsp;</p><p>Out of the four options available, BMW, Range Rover, Ferrari, Telsa, 64% of men thought that a BMW would secure them a second date, while Tesla scored just 7%, proving that green isnt always smarter. At 30%, it seems that women are less impressed with a Bimmer. Tesla won the race with 58%.&nbsp;</p><p>While men prefer the classic, strong, status of the BMW to showcase their worth, women are more impressed by new technology and eco alternatives. Women prefer Teslas because it shows that the man still has enough money in his pocket to treat her like a Queen but also has the sensitivity to care about the planet the source said, who wants to remain anonymous, even the rich women like a sensitive man.&nbsp;</p><p>More Brand Preference Surveys To Come</p><p>Luxy will be re-visiting these brand preferences on a regular basis and our next brand preference rankings will focus on fashion and travel. Heres a bit more about the Luxy app itself.</p><p><br></p><p>About Luxy:&nbsp;</p><p>It works just like Tinder, said the CEO of Luxy With one big exception: Our app is for wealthy people only. Its basically Tinder minus the poor people.</p><p><br></p><p>It was really just a matter of time. With Tinder, Grindr and others carving out a niche for themselves in the world of high-speed digital dating, Luxy has launched to work in the same way.</p><p><br></p><p>Its Tinder without low-income dating prospects. In fact, the average income of male users on Luxy is over $200k.</p><p><br></p><p>Like Tinder, based on the results of potential candidates, the app allows the user to anonymously like or pass them by swiping or tapping. If two users like each other then it results in a "Match" and Luxy introduces the two users and opens a chat.</p><p><br></p><p>Who doesnt want to date somebody both attractive and wealthy? Privately, we all know we prefer to have both of these things. One user said: Tinder was pretty awesome when it came out, but theres a lot of riff raff on there. [I] would rather know the guy has a couple bucks in his pocket.</p><p><br></p><p>With the rise of high-speed digital dating, its about time somebody introduced a filter to weed out low-income prospects by neighborhood, said the CEO of Luxy.</p><p><br></p><p>Another user wrote: Does this mean that were all going to flock to Beverly Hills on a Friday night to make a match? Maybe, thats not a bad idea!</p><p><br></p><p>For media inquiries, please contact: press@onluxy.com.</p><p><br></p><p>About Luxy</p><p>                                 </p><p>Luxy is the #1 luxury dating app which has been bringing together successful singles. There are many successful persons on the site, including CEOs, professional athletes, doctors, lawyers, investors, entrepreneurs, beauty queens, fitness models and Hollywood celebrities.</p><div><br></div>

<p>"Enhancing Land, Enriching lives."  Who would not be captivated by that promise? Right? It is given that people wants to live in a place where they can call it a home. What we all want most in life is the ability to maintain a healthy and satisfying lifestyle. And a home is where we can find and have a safety, contentment and comfort in our lives. For some, investing in<b> </b><a href="http://www.avidaland.com/condominium">Avida Towers condominium</a><b> </b>would give them the satisfaction they want in life.&nbsp; But before anything else, some of you here might think why and what makes Avida Land liveable. Well for one reason, they don't just invest in the real estate itself, they also invest in people.</p><p>Over the years, Avida organization has seven units with a close to 200-strong workforce teaming up to perform excellently real estate developments for their clients. That includes the Office of the President, Finance, Supply Chain Management, Marketing and Sales, Project and Strategic Management, Technical Services and Human Resources and Customer Care. Without these pillars, coming up with excellent strategies on how they can make a property liveable for their clients may not be accomplished efficiently and successful. </p><p>Members of the Avida organization do not just do their duties and responsibilities; they also practice good values or traits that promote growth and development by providing an environment that creates creativity, productivity, and professionalism. Of course, having these traits would have better results, not just to their clients, but also to their working environment. Additionally, they also value integrity, quality, customer orientation, teamwork and their commitment to delivering excellent works for their clients. That means, real estate professionals, contractors, and other personnel undergo several training modules designed to enhance selling and entrepreneurial skills and aimed at increasing their personal economic potential in their respective field.</p><p>And as a real estate developer, they don't just build properties intended for their clients within the country; they also provide homes for overseas Filipinos who wish to have their home. In 2003, more representative offices were opened in Singapore and in Dubai in 2005. Moreover, their markets have extended in countries such as Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, among many other countries.&nbsp; Of course, the properties are not only intended for Filipino people but also, foreigners who also wish to avail can have a safe home in Avida land.</p><p>        </p><p>Through their well-designed features, more and more people have already achieved their desired dreams  to have their home. With that, they bring the joy that uplifts the lives of more Filipinos all throughout the countries.</p>
<p>Buying a property which you always dreamed of is never been easy since it's not just a house you have to buy, it's an investment for lifetime. Opting for property which is most suitable to you is one of the biggest decisions of your life and the most captious part towards your dream house. Moreover it will make a very big hole in your pocket and will take up most of your savings. Even if you are thinking to take a home loan, a bulk amount from your monthly salary will go into EMIs. Many variables drives the decision such as location,budget, Area per sqft along with some personal choices. Also some points are considered specific to the property type apart from affordability,location or luxury.</p><p><img width="525" alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/T-A7kaVfChvnv3_hkJW15UY98DFKrqgmwdXYWLC2_byFblHPd2UeD62Rih9yRsyXS_KATfmQG-7ZZHmlu6Vmv_br2rGe17JgVxvSDkVyjAZKdrGHFQwdLXmmvRN5eJFWr-jbEpA4" height="350" title="Image: https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/T-A7kaVfChvnv3_hkJW15UY98DFKrqgmwdXYWLC2_byFblHPd2UeD62Rih9yRsyXS_KATfmQG-7ZZHmlu6Vmv_br2rGe17JgVxvSDkVyjAZKdrGHFQwdLXmmvRN5eJFWr-jbEpA4"></p><p><br></p><p>First and the foremost thing which needs to be kept in mind is that it is always innocuous to buy a property <a href="https://www.realtycompass.com/property-view-shriram-chirpingwoods-by-shriram-properties-private-ltd-in-bangalore-east" target="_blank">Shriram Chirping Woods</a> which is legally approved. Buyer should always opt for the property for which government bodies have approved its map before entering into any kind of agreement or contract. Secondly one must always go by the track record of builder to ensure quality product and timely delivery of your valuable property. Generally all good builders keep a track record of their profile and the work done by them previously, so its always better to ask them for that to have an idea about their background. Thirdly project location should be chosen wisely keeping future perspective in mind. Though it is always a personal choice whether to buy your dream house on main road keeping location benefits in mind as compared to the ones which are inside. But remember one thing we are buying a house and not an office space, so your personal space plays a foremost role here and down the line you should not regret your decision of buying a property on main road due to sound and traffic pollution. Fourthly, you should have the knowledge of carpet area, built-up and super- built up areas and before making up your mind to buy a property just don't neglect to figure out the extra costs. Generally the builder charges for super- built up area and the buyer must understand all this calculation before signing into any kind of contract or agreement. &nbsp;Fifthly, never go by sample flats, many-a-times investors just end up getting ditched by the images of sample flats and later finds out that it does not look like the one which was shown to them. Freebies are just to attract buyers but in actual nothing is free and the cost is already included in the price of the apartment <a href="https://www.realtycompass.com/property-view-magnificia-by-sattva-group-in-bangalore-east" target="_blank">Salarpuria Sattva Magnificia</a> . Lastly, it all comes down to the price of your dream house. A buyer must do a complete survey about the prices in that location in which he is willing to take his house after keeping in mind various parameters such as amenities, &nbsp;quality of construction, possession date etc. Also negotiation is as much necessary as buying a grocery from builder because it might somehow save your hard earned money.</p>
<p> LifeUp Health Coaching is an health coaching<b> </b>program offered by one of the best integrative health coach in LA, Derek Opperman. The program helps people set clear and solid plans that are designed to deal with modern lifestyle hazards like sleep deprivation, lack of a balanced diet, stress and weight issues.</p><p>LifeUp Coaching has announced its exclusive new online fitness program New Year New You for people looking to lose 20 pounds or more. True to its name, the program is designed to kick start a completely personalized journey to adopting lifelong dedication to health and fitness. To be able to extract maximum benefits, Derek Opperman, the creator of this program, has limited the intake to just 10 people.<br></p><p> <br> </p><p> Every New Year witnesses people renewing their commitment to eating healthy and living an active and wholesome lifestyle. However, as it goes with resolutions, its easy to lose steam. Dereks integrative health coaching attacks the very core of this problem by delivering a solution personalized to the needs and lifestyle of each person.  </p><p> <br> </p><p> Anyone looking to get a fit and healthy lifestyle can avail a free consultation before they take the dive. LifeUps targeted program focuses on the most important components of achieving every level of ones fitness goal. It does this by using a variety of powerful tools that are laser focused on producing results. This includes:</p><p> <br> </p><ul> 	<li><p> 	Custom built nutrition plan</p> 	</li><li><p> 	Detailed grocery list</p> 	</li><li><p> 	Personalized work out</p> 	</li><li><p> 	An interactive app to track 	progress</p> 	</li><li><p> 	A 90 Day Challenge with fitness 	prizes to be won at the end</p> 	</li><li><p> 	A money back guarantee of the 	same number of days</p> </li></ul><p> <br> </p><p> Members learned to pick up exactly the things that work for them and help achieve fitness faster. The limited number of seats allows Derek to deliver one-on-one guidance and a magnified ability to achieve results. Matt, who successfully completed LifeUps 90 days program last year says, <i>Derek is laser focused. Ive never had a trainer who was so organized in keeping track of my fitness programs. We came up with a food plan that accommodated busy travel schedule and still got results</i></p><p> <br> </p><p> The best part of the program is possibly the fact that it does not need clients to change their lifestyle. On the contrary it takes an organic and sensible approach to slowly reinventing current eating habits and reforming it into something highly tailored to a clients lifestyle and schedule. Derek is setting a practical standard for achieving fitness goals in the New Year. The program is open for a limited number of people for a limited time.

<p>Foreclosure is an evil thing to admit to. You admit your'e a bum, a cheat, a liar and broke. You admit to the world and your neighbors, that you are somehow not as good as everyone else. And you admit, you can't afford your home anymore. For a long while there, I probably shouldn't have felt so bad about it, it seems everyone I knew was facing some sort of financial downfall, but just the same, when they told me that my house was going into foreclosure, a sick feeling of despair set upon me and I knew I had been beaten.</p><p>The reason why I fell behind in my payments started several years before the actual paperwork and sheriffs order to vacate came. It started well before I even missed my first payment. It started when I became the sole breadwinner in my home, and I realized my job was not paying enough to carry the whole enchilada.</p><p>Truth be told I didn't really care to own the home. I lived on a boat year round, was quite happy to do my laundry at the laundromat and slept in 10 degree temps with my faithful pup cuddled up in my sleeping bag. I showered at the gym, ate dinner at the bar and only slept four hours a night anyway, so why did I need a home to do that?</p><p>Turns out, I needed a home not for me, but for my family- my two dogs and a my cat. And another family member that I wasn't so proud to admit I lived with, my Mom. I didn't really live with my Mom, but when my Dad died so many years back, it kind of fell to me to care for her, so it was a tentative balance that she lived in the house and I lived on the boat. And we all could be most self respectable that way. Unfortunately in 2012, a great recession, a job loss, a fight for boaters rights, a dog bite incident and a freak October snow fall hit and that tentative balance was thrown into chaos. A so my life would change and my home would slide into Foreclosure, despite my fiercest attempts to fight it.</p><p>It was early 2012, when I finally missed my first mortgage payment. That month, money was tight and I had been fighting with the bank to modify my mortgage payments since 2010. I couldn't pay my mortgage for the first time ever, but I had every intention of catching up the next month. The next month, it was same the deal, just not enough money. And then as the bills piled up, the job market slowed down and the dog managed to sneak out of the house and bite a bicyclist who wandered down the the dead end dirt road along my property line, the tide turned against me.</p><br>

<p>CHICAGO, Ill. (January 20, 2016)  The January 2016 issue of <i>Architectural Record</i> highlights the innovative design and educational functionality of GEMS World Academy  Chicagos vertical campus. The school, which combines a strong international curriculum with an emphasis on systems thinking and an innovative approach to technology, is featured alongside groundbreaking school buildings in Germany, England, Croatia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan, and Brazil. <br> <br> The profile recognizes the schools successful integration into Chicagos Lakeshore East neighborhood and the creation of a technology-enhanced, state-of-the-art learning environment.&nbsp; Teaching and collaborative spaces work together to maximize student-teacher engagement  allowing students and teachers to experience a one-to-one connection within the schools larger context. The school is seen as a dynamic, interactive learning hub where students and faculty gather, learn, and explore together. Along with GEMSs expert educators, uninterrupted views of Chicagos city center and museum campus inspire students each day. This sense of place is particularly important to GEMS because the school marries theory and practice via a world as our campus approach  students regularly engage with corporate, civic, and social leaders throughout the city on regular field explorations called Field Studies.&nbsp;</p><p>The 10-story GEMS World Academy  Chicago Lower School opened in 2014. The Chicago-based architecture firm, bKL, designed the building, which houses students from preschool to 8th grade. bKLs design for the GEMS school also received the International Interior Design Association Illinois Chapter 2014 Red Award for Educational PK-12 Project and the <i>Engineering News-Record</i>s Best Projects Award of Merit for K-12 Education, 2015.</p><p>This school was designed by bKL with the purpose of facilitating academic excellence, said Geoff Jones, GEMS World Academy-Chicagos head of school. The vertical design encourages older students to interact and become academic role models for our younger students, helping create a powerful preschool-to-12 education.</p><p>We are honored that Architectural Record has showcased GEMS World Academy-Chicago in the Schools of the 21st Century edition for 2016, stated bKL Architectures Education Practice Leader, Lynne Sorkin. Inclusion of the Lower School in this prestigious publication is a testament to the successful international collaboration between bKL and GEMS representatives. The resulting efficient mid-rise design optimizes natural light, enables flexibility, incorporates state-of-the-art learning spaces and creates a strong sense of place.</p><p><b><i>About Architectural Record:</i></b> <br>Founded in 1891, <i>Architectural Record</i>&nbsp;is a top source for news and information about architecture and design.

<p>  </p><p><i>MIT Spinoff Brings 10 Years of Research and Software Development, <br> Plus Leadership in the First On-Demand Public Pilot</i></p><p>  </p><p>CAMBRIDGE, MA., January 26, 2016  nuTonomy Inc., developer of advanced software for autonomous vehicles, today announced it has closed a $3.6M seed funding round, with investments from Signal Ventures, Samsung Ventures, Fontinalis Partners and Dr. Steven LaValle. The funding will help support nuTonomys continued work in the U.S. as well as in Singapore, where industry and government are jointly piloting autonomous vehicle technology. nuTonomys software is currently being integrated and tested by automotive partners in both the U.S. and Europe, with the goal of deploying self-driving features within the next few years.</p><p>  </p><p>nuTonomys vision is to deliver the worlds smartest autonomous vehicle and be the software engine of automated cars, said Karl Iagnemma, CEO and co-founder of nuTonomy. By applying advanced techniques from the aerospace industry, were creating a self-driving car that is safe, confident and drives in a truly human-like manner.</p><p>  </p><p>nuTonomy is pioneering a new technique for decision-making based on methods that have been used in the development of spacecraft, airplanes and other complex automated vehicles. Other approaches to automated driving, which rely on cumbersome, rigid decision-making logic, result in vehicles that frequently drive in an overly cautious, jerky and uncertain manner. </p><p>  </p><p><a>We are impressed with nuTonomys technical acumen, especially their leadership in decision-making methods for vehicles, said Amit Garg, strategic investments, Samsung Global Innovation Center. Partnering across the spectrum in the industry will be essential to turning years of research into an everyday reality. </a></p><p>  </p><p>nuTonomys founders have been researching and creating autonomous vehicle technology since 2005. The MIT-based visionaries behind nuTonomy have developed robotic technology with funding from NASA and DARPA. The two have already built and tested dozens of autonomous vehicle prototypes over the past decade. </p><p>  </p><p>Co-founder and CTO Emilio Frazzoli previously directed the first open-to-the-public pilot of on-demand automated vehicles. The pilot, which took place in Singapore in 2014, enabled more than 500 Singaporean citizens to experience an Uber-like service to request driverless transportation throughout the Jurong Lake Gardens, a central public park. That experience, led by <a href="http://smart.mit.edu/research/future-urban-mobility/future-urban-mobility.html">SMART</a> (Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology), enabled the team to prove the demand for autonomous vehicle technology in Singapore. nuTonomy has built upon this experience to develop technology for city-wide management of autonomous vehicle fleets in urban settings. </p><p>  </p><p>Autonomous vehicle technology will disrupt and redefine the future of urban mobility and transportation, said Chris Thomas, a founder and partner of Fontinalis Partners, who will join the nuTomony Board. We feel strongly that nuTomonys robust approach to decision-making will position them to be a leading player in this disruption. </p><p>  </p><p>The seed round funding included investment from:</p><p>  </p><ul><li><p>Signal Ventures, an affiliate of Signal Ventures Ltd. (lead)-- founded by Ioannis Martinos in 2015, Signal Ventures focuses on early stage investments in robotics and autonomous technology.</p></li><li><p>Fontinalis Partners  a firm solely focused on investing in and scaling technology companies that are advancing next-generation mobility </p></li><li><p>Samsung Ventures  a division of Samsung that invests in early-stage software and services innovations</p></li><li><p>Dr. Steven M. LaValle  former Chief Scientist of Oculus VR, which was acquired by Facebook; Dr. LaValle also serves as an advisor to nuTonomy.</p></li></ul><p>        </p><p><b>About nuTonomy</b></p><p>  </p><p>nuTonomy develops state-of-the-art software to enable autonomous urban driving, for use in both privately-owned vehicles and mobility as a service (i.e., autonomous taxis). nuTonomy was founded by two leaders in the autonomous vehicle space, Drs. Karl Iagnemma and Emilio Frazzoli of MIT, and employs experts in perception, motion planning, and decision-making. With PhDs from MIT, Caltech, and other leading academic institutions, nuTonomys team has developed more than a dozen autonomous vehicle prototypes that have been tested in the U.S., Singapore, and Europe.

If yes, then it is important for you to know certain tips that can make it easy for you to complete swimming, cycling and running activities. To participate in NY Tri Expo, it is important for you to stay healthy.</p> <p> Here are few rules which beginners should follow while planning to participate in Triathlon Expo NY:</p> <p> First rule: Eat properly</p> <p> When you are preparing for the race it is vital that you focus on your diet. Eat good food and stay fit! A day before the race, start giving your body good food. In nervousness, generally people eat less and sleep less. This can affect your body mechanism. So it is advisable to eat and drink water properly. This definitely does not mean that you are allowed to carry out over eating. Include protein in your diet. Beef, fish, turkey, beans, chicken are good source of protein. Ensure you do not include sweets and sugary drinks.</p> <p> Rule #2: Don't over drink</p> <p> Water is essential to satisfy your thirst before, during and after the race. It is important that you do not drink water during nervousness. Drink water 8 minutes before you start the race. Drink water depending on your sweating.</p> <p> Third rule: Get details about transition area</p> <p> It is important to get details about swimming entrance, bike out and run out area. You should know about the placement in NY Tri Expo. Even in Triathlon workshops NY, you can get suggestions related to saving time while carrying out transition from one game to another. Once you know what the order is then it can be simple to you to move forward.</p> <p> Fourth rule: Do warm up rather than simply standing</p> <p> Take yourself to the aerobic zone. Before half an hour of the race, you need to start with the warm up sessions. Don't just stand out of nervousness. It is vital for the beginner triathlete NY to know this. Wear gloves and hood if required while carrying out warm up session. Half an hour before the race you can do elephant walk, torso twist and other exercises.</p> <p> Fifth rule: Find out smart swim methods</p> <p> It is crucial to have a look at swim course properly. Know about the turns in advance so that you are not confused during swimming. Some people also make a note of the swimming area where sun directly affects your eye. After you start swimming, take deep breaths. Panicky breaths can make swimming difficult for you. In order to avoid vertigo problem after coming out of water, you need to stand up slowly maintaining proper stability. This makes it simple to transfer from one activity to another during the <a title="Link: http://nytriexpo.com/" target="_blank" href="http://nytriexpo.com/">NY Tri Expo</a>.</p> <p> Drink and eat smartly during the transition period.</p>  <br>

It protects the ownership of the tagline, logo, name or any mark that you use to identify a business's services and products. There are some reasons that you need to know to register mark when you créer sa marque in order to protect it.</b></p> <p> <b>#1 Notice</b></p> <p> <b>Get notice of ownership with registration of marque déposée. This is certainly not the most compelling reason to register the business mark. Third party cannot use your mark if you carry out registration process aptly. Thus this will put on notice that same or identical use of the mark can lead to infringement. Third party will be compelled to look out for some another trademark. Prevent conflicts by registering trademark.</b></p> <p> <b>#2 Social media</b></p> <p> <b>Social media is known to be a vital resource for a number of businesses. Clients search for the brand names on many social media websites such as Twitter, Facebook and the rest. In order to protect against improper activities each and every social media website adopts certain policies. Unluckily, the practice of an individual or people improperly using another firms name or even brand on the social medial for financial gain is certainly not uncommon. Majority of the time social media account may get suspended by carrying out such wrong practices.</b></p> <p> <b>It is important on your part to check out the policies drafted by social media websites. At the time you complain to the social media website about the wrongdoing and claim another person using the brand without your consent, then the administrator would ask you for the proof of the ownership of the mark when you créer sa marque.

<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b><br><br>Michael McDonald and David Sanborn join forces with producer/drummer Mike Mesey and guitarist Steve Scorfina for new version of "Johnny B. Goode," featuring original piano track by the late Johnnie Johnson<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>ST. LOUIS, MO  New life has been breathed into one of the most iconic rock and roll songs of all time  Chuck Berry's "Johnny B. Goode"  featuring some serious star-power, including a previously unreleased piano track by the song's inspiration, Johnnie Johnson, as well as Grammy-winners Michael McDonald and David Sanborn.<br><br>The story of this new version of "Johnny B. Goode," recorded in New York, St. Louis and Los Angeles, goes back a few years to when drummer/producer Mike Mesey, who played and toured with Head East, Chuck Berry, and Johnson, asked Johnson to play piano on a recording of "Johnny B. Goode." Johnson was happy and excited to oblige, providing the only studio recording of him ever playing the song. Years after Johnson's death in 2005, Mesey heard a lap steel guitar performance by Steve Scorfina, formerly of Pavlov's Dog and REO Speedwagon, and immediately thought of Johnson's piano tracks. Scorfina recorded for the song on a 1934 Rickenbacker lap steel  regarded as the first electric guitar.<br><br>After recording his lap steel tracks, Scorfina suggested contacting his childhood friend and former Majestics band mate from Ferguson, Mo., five-time Grammy winner Michael McDonald, about recording a vocal track. McDonald, a fan of both Berry and Johnson, liked the project and obliged by recording amazing vocals. Another St. Louis native, saxophone legend David Sanborn, lent his talents to the recording as well; and Jimmy Vivino, longtime music director for the Conan O'Brien band agreed to record additional guitar tracks.<br><br>During discussions about how to proceed with the new "Johnny B. Goode" recording, the conversation shifted to using the song to help raise funds for a new rock documentary, "Johnnie Be Good," about Johnnie Johnson's life, produced by Art Holliday and including interviews with McDonald, Sanborn and Vivino, as well as a "who's who" of rock music including: Keith Richards, Eric Clapton, Bob Weir, the late Bo Diddley, Bonnie Raitt, John Sebastian, Joe Perry, Dr. John, Buddy Guy, film director Taylor Hackford, Bruce Hornsby, former Late Show band leader Paul Shaffer, Rolling Stones keyboardist Chuck Leavell, The Kentucky Headhunters, actor Malcolm<br>McDowell, Oscar-winner Lou Gossett, Jr., Eddie Money and Conan O'Brien band members Jimmy Mike Merritt, and James Wormworth.<br><br>The new version of "Johnny B. Goode" was officially released for download on October 18, 2015 in honor of Chuck Berry's birthday and is available on 25 websites including: <br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;ITUNES: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/johnny-b.-goode-feat.-michael/id1046734481">https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/johnny-b.-goode-feat.-michael/id1046734481</a><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;CD BABY: <a href="https://www.cdbaby.com/cd/meseyscorfinafeaturingmi">https://www.cdbaby.com/cd/meseyscorfinafeaturingmi</a><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;AMAZON: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Michael--?McDonald--?%20Johnnie--?Johnson--?Sanborn/dp/B0168LQFX0.">http://www.amazon.com/Michael--?McDonald--?%20Johnnie--?Johnson--?Sanborn/dp/B0168LQFX0.</a><br><br>Preview song <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/get_sample_url.html/ref=dm_dp_trk_B0168LQHC4?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B0168LQHC4&amp;DownloadLocation=WEBSITE">http://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/get_sample_url.html/ref=dm_dp_trk_B0168LQHC4?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B0168LQHC4&amp;DownloadLocation=WEBSITE</a>.<br><br>Track sales proceeds will help fund the release of the upcoming "Johnnie Be Good" documentary.

Matthews, NC  January 26, 2016  With thousands of homes affected by the weekend power outages across the eastern half of the U.S., the SmartCharge Light may be the ideal lighting source for future emergencies.<br><br>SmartCharge Light is preparing its second-generation of energy efficient LED Light Bulbs for shipment later this spring, with initial samples already in hand. The second-generation product builds on the success with the SmartCharge Light, the worlds only light bulb with Switch and Grid Sensor technology that enables the switch to operate normally (on/ off) even when the power is out. And it provides up to four hours of backup light thanks to a built-in battery.<br><br>Significant improvements are coming for SmartCharge 2.0. Nearly twice as bright at 650 lumens as the original SmartCharge light bulb, SmartCharge 2.0 will also carry a lower suggested retail price less than $25. With the 2.0 version of SmartCharge, one wall switch can now control multiple bulbs on a circuit, explains Shaliendra Suman, CEO of SmartCharge Light parent company TVL International, a Matthews, North Carolina leader in intelligent connected devices. The bulb works on all supply voltages between 110V and 240V, so it can be used in any country in the world. The consumer can also put the bulb in charge-only mode, where the back-up battery is recharged without the bulb being lit.<br><br>Were now operating a crowdfunding campaign on IndieGoGo to raise the $50,000 needed to put the product into mass production, and were very pleased with initial reaction to our second generation SmartCharge product, Suman said. SmartCharge has applicable UL, CE, FCC and ROHS certifications and the company is looking for distributors all over the world. A limited number of samples are available for distributors to test.<br><br>The SmartCharge LED Bulb looks like a normal light bulb from the outside, but it has technology built inside to enable wall switch control of the lights even when the power is out with no extra wiring required. SmartCharge lets the consumer have light during a power outage when its needed such as during the recent winter storm in the eastern part of the United Stated and also conserve battery power to extend the time that light from the SmartCharge Bulb is available.<br><br>The heart of the SmartCharge Bulb is the patent-pending Grid &amp; Switch Sensor technology, which is able to distinguish between a loss of power due to opening of the line switch and a loss of power from a grid failure.<br><br>TVL shipped more than 8,000 first-generation SmartCharge Light Bulbs to customers in more than 30 countries and last November in California, the SmartCharge won the National Sustainability Award in the Cleantech Open Global Forum  the worlds largest accelerator of early-stage clean-technology companies.

<p>&nbsp;San Jose, CA  January 30, 2016  1World Online has started off 2016 by initiating full deployment of its platform 2.0 release. What had started as a feed of user polls has now evolved into a multi-purpose solution for data and advertising. The platform, now updated to display a full overview of user engagement metrics, now also supports advertising for businesses- either through their own provider or through 1Worlds selection of leading advertising networks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1Worlds poll, quiz, survey, and debate tools can all be advertising-enabled and the interactive units themselves can be sponsored material. Of these units, 1Worlds Sponsored Quizzes has generated the most interest amongst partners. With existing quizzes gaining tens of thousands of completions in the span of a week alone, the advertising potential for brands through this new form of native advertising surpasses that of any other existing solution in the market. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Quizzes are a natural fit for sponsorship. As pieces of standalone content, quizzes are already one of the most popular items on social media. When coupled with brands or advertisers, quizzes are still fun for the user, but have the added benefit of generating quality data and leads says Alex Fedosseev, the CEO of 1World. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Embracing its user-generated roots, the platforms polling unit also allows for unregistered audiences to submit their own questions via the unit itself. Multiple 1World media partners, for an example, have integrated this feature into their articles- allowing for increased user engagement and time on site.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The data analytics portion of this platform update is what provides the link between data and advertising. Data collected through each unit engagement is processed to serve up personalized ads to each user, based on their responses. Through this, brands are abled to have better targeted ads and audience members become more relevant- becoming a whole new approach to hyper-targeted advertising. An ever-occurring issue in advertising now has a simple and obvious solution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>                                           </p><p>As 1Worlds platform continues to progress, the company has also continued to expand its global presence. 1World now has offices present in North America, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Southeastern Asia, and India, which are all generating momentum in new language integrations and localized partnership agreements. For the past 6 months, the company has received a rate of one million new users per quarter and has now reached the milestone of 5 million users worldwide. </p>

<p>In India, we are struggling with double burden of malnutrition and childhood obesity. Malnutrition remains a silent emergency, for which the Government of India has made significant progress in the past several years by implementing schemes like Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) and Mid Day Meal (MDM) and on the other side the rates of overweight and obesity are also steadily increasing. Many factors like urbanization, and changing dietary patterns and lifestyles, are causing the rate of obesity and overweight to increase within the school children. Approximately 20% school children are obese in India. Obesity related conditions such as sleep apnea, heart diseases , high blood pressure and diabetes are estimated to cost the Indian economy $ 200 billion because of hospitalizations, prescription medications and paying a premium on their insurance from 2005- 2015 which is presumed to grow more sharply in coming years.</p><p>To deal with increasing obesity among children, a government-appointed committee which has suggested few measures including ban on sale of junk food in and around schools. The Committee on Consumption of Junk Food by School Children, set up by the Women and Child Development Ministry, has suggested a comprehensive definition of junk food in the context of children and that all such food items should be banned in school canteens. Many schools all over India have stopped sale of junk food in their canteens after a circular issued by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) warned against food high on fat, sugar and salt (HFSS).</p><p>The committee recommended:</p><ul><li>Most common junk foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) such as chips, fried foods, sugar sweetened carbonated beverages, sugar sweetened non-carbonated beverages, ready-to-eat noodles, pizzas, burgers, potato fries and confectionery items should be restricted in schools and 200 meters nearby.</li><li>Advertisement and promotion of such foods targeted at children is to be regulated through a framework that includes all types of media, celebrity endorsements and promotional activities.</li><li>A canteen policy should be implemented based on color coding. Green category foods -- the healthy food options -- should constitute about 80 per cent of available foods. Red category of select most common junk foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar should not be sold or served in schools. Suggested, healthy menu options should include fruit salad, fruits, paneer / vegetable cutlets, khandvi, poha, uthapam, upma, idlis and kathi rolls, low fat milk shakes with seasonal fruits and no added sugar, fresh fruit juice and smoothies with fruits, fresh lime soda, badam milk, lassi etc.</li><li>The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) should fix limits of unhealthy ingredients such as transfats to 5 per cent at the earliest.</li><li>Labelling regulations must be strengthened by the FSSAI to enable complete and transparent information on the amount of fat, salt and sugar with reference to recommended daily allowed limits.</li><li>Schools should promote nutrition education and awareness for children. A well-structured curriculum on balanced diet and its health impacts should be introduced.</li></ul><p>All school children spend maximum of their productive time every day in the school. The school environment has a significant impact on the development of eating habits and health of the children and influence majorly on health promoting behaviours. School canteens are an important influence on children's diets as children frequently eat whatever is available in the school canteen on school days. As a result, the food products sold in canteens may directly influence as well as have an impact on school performance through children's energy levels and ability to concentrate.</p><p>To promote the nutritional education and awareness for school children, SHARP NGO initiated a unique and innovative School Health &amp; Nutrition Education Program that aims to inculcate healthy habits among children through increased health literacy. The program named as MHMH (My health in my hands) invokes a sense of responsibility among school children to take ownership of their nutritional health.</p><p>Under this project, health check-up is conducted for all the students and the collected health data will be stored at the SHARP repository. It is updated regularly by follow-up check-ups. The children are given 'SHARP Health &amp; Nutrition Card' with unique ID number after the health screening.</p><p>"My Health in My Hands" program is an attempt to inculcate healthy habits among school children through increased health literacy. In this program children are made aware about the importance of eating balanced diet, getting healthy tiffin box in school and health hazards associated with the consumption of junk food. Children were also educated on the need to have safe and clean environment in canteen to ensure the safety of food which they are consuming. To provide a learning environment for this activity, children were encouraged to conductCanteen audits in their own school to inspect the quality of food served and the type of safety and hygiene measures practised in canteen. While conducting these audits, children inspected various aspects of safety and hygiene practised by canteen personnel while preparing, storing and serving food like cleanliness of cooking, storage and serving area, their personal hygiene, freshness of raw products used in food preparation, cleanliness of utensils used. On the one hand this activity gave children a deep understanding of the concern, on the other hand it alsoencouraged schools to maintain canteen in accordance with CBSE guidelines.</p><p>The program culmination will happen with exciting intra and inter school competitions like group discussions, quizzes, extempore and poster competition. The Final inter school championship will have short film competition and a skit competition among participating schools.</p><p>Dr.Puran Prakash, Gen Secy of SHARP NGO said, "MHMH program was really appreciated by the school authorities and parents for its holistic approach towards health and well being of children. By making children track their daily food intake for a period of 3 months, the program attempted 'habit formation' along with awareness. Children too enjoyed the awareness activities and what they like the most about this program, was their dual role of learners and campaigners. Looking at program's impact and acceptance with schools, we plan to make it PAN India from next academic session."</p><p>The program was rolled out in Aug'2015 in few private schools of Delhi and NCR namely Ryan International School, DLF Public School, N K Bagrodia School, Summer Fields School, Bal Bharti Public School, St. Paul's school and many more.</p><p>Notes to Editor</p><p>School Health Annual Report Programme (SHARP) is India's largest school health network which is helping companies to fulfill the corporate social responsibility. SHARP is a non-govt. organization (NGO) with scientifically planned health programme for school children, professionally managed under the guidance of eminent medical experts, sociologists, educationist, psychologists, nutritional specialists and others who have vision of promoting healthcare of children throughout the third world countries. The programme is unique in being the first programme to computerize and place health records of children on the internet. The programme's innovative approach has made it the most popular school health programme in the country with more than a million children across all sections of the society taking benefit out of it through its various projects.</p><p>SHARP has a holistic and comprehensive approach which is spread in a wide geographical area, caters to various stakeholders and provides eminent services to uplift and empower the society to bring it on the path of sustainable development which can strengthen future of our Nation" For more details, please log on to our website: <a href="http://www.schoolindia.org">www.schoolindia.org</a>.</p><p><br></p>

<p>Oil traders were in for a crazy ride today. It was trading steadly when around mid-Europe the oilprices started rising. Lets look at what happened event by event </p><p><br></p><p><b>1 - Baker Hughes Trigger</b></p><p>The first bullish trigger came from the Baker Hughes report, which said oil rigs across the globe could fall by 30% in 2016. Prices rallied and understandably so!</p><p>The Basic economic law is at work here:&nbsp;Oil prices fall&nbsp;= rigs run into losses and close down = supply drops = prices recover</p><p>So the resulting uptick was normal.</p><p><br></p><p><b>2 - Markets are irrational, always have and always will be</b></p><p>What followed later was an erratic short squeeze - When the sentiment is extremely bearish even the most out of the world news is enough to trigger a correction.</p><p>There was increase in press speculation that&nbsp;'Saudi Arabia was in favor of 5% production cut by all major producers'.</p><p>The news came through from the Russian oil minister, who also said a meeting would be scheduled on Tuesday.</p><p>And boom!&nbsp;prices rallied -&nbsp;Brent rose to a three-week high and WTI oil rose to a 2-1/2 week high.</p><p>But </p><p><b>3 - New player in the game: One does not simply expect OPEC too wait-and-watch</b></p><p>Within an hour Reuters, Bloomberg, and Dow Jones were out to spoil the Oil bull party &nbsp;OPEC rejected joint production cut, sources said&nbsp;Iran wont accept production cut and the Russian minister was caught saying that 'it would be too early to talk about a joint effort'.</p><p>And thus oil prices fell back to levels seen after Baker Hughes news was priced-in by the markets.</p><p>This is clearly an irrational  Iran would never agree for production cut, Bringing US, Canada, Russia, OPEC  Saudi and Iran all on the same page is as good as climbing Mount Everest daily.<br></p><p><br></p><p>Later, we witnessed a short squeeze. Smart traders went in and got out quickly..like a hot shower bath.</p><p>If oil prices rally above the falling trendline on the technical charts, a move towards $37 is likely</p>

<p>Do you find <a href="http://www.mofain.com/">hair weavings</a> to be dull and without vitality? Do you feel fed up with its look? Fortunately, there are a number of options that can help you to restore and rejuvenate the look and feel of your hair. Read through this article to learn how changing your hair can help change your life forever, and for the better.<br></p><p>For minimizing breakage, be sure that your hair is completely wet prior to applying shampoo. Don't use any more than about a quarter-size dollop. Then proceed to rub the shampoo in between your palms to start with. Be sure to lather up for no more than 30 seconds or so.<br></p><p>While a pony tail is an easy way to style your hair when you don't have a lot of time, it's best not to style your hair this way, too often. Keeping your hair pulled back with a hair tie can lead to hair loss and damage. Be sure to change up the way you style your hair.</p><p>When you are getting ready to wash your hair with shampoo, make sure that you rinse it out thoroughly before you apply the shampoo. This will remove any residue, such as dirt and dust that your hair may have accumulated. You will get more cleansing power from your shampoo by doing this.</p><p>To get the best looking <b>clip in hair extensions</b> possible, consider using a leave-in conditioner. These conditioners give you the amazing effects that you typically associate with normal conditioner, but the effects last all day long! You'll find leave-in conditioners at your local drug store or salon, in either, lotion or spray-on form.</p><p>If you happen to suffer from a flaky scalp, try using this treatment bi-weekly: Start sectioning your hair and do a gentle rubbing on your scalp using a rubbing alcohol-saturated cotton pad. Once the alcohol dries, start brushing your hair. Finish with a thorough rinse using warm water, and be sure not to shampoo.</p><p>During the summer months, it's crucial that you put extra effort into caring for your hair. Always take the time to wash your hair after swimming or spending time in the sun. It's also a good idea to keep your hair covered with a bandanna or a loose cap, if you plan on being out all day.</p><p>Do not use any settings on your blow dryer that dry your hair with heat. Heat is very damaging to your hair, especially in an effort to dry your hair quickly. Use the cool setting, and dry your hair in a healthy manner. Doing this daily can make a big difference.</p><p>When you finish bathing, skip the blow dryer. Air drying your hair encourages volume and discourages frizz. If you must use a blow dryer, consider using it on the cool setting to encourage the sheath of your hair strands to lay down. This encourages the illusion of shine and is better for your hair than heat.</p><p>Get a haircut every six to nine weeks to keep your hair looking its best. Over time, your hair will break and the ends will split. This creates uneven layers that make your hair look unhealthy and dull. Getting frequent haircuts will help to keep the ends from splitting all the way up to the roots, and help keep your hair shinier and healthier.</p><p>Natural <b>remy human hair weavings </b>brushes are the best choice when it comes to brushes for your hair. The bristles are softer and will flex more. The flexible brushes will cause less damage than using a brush that has stiff, plastic bristles on it. Be sure to choose one that also has smooth tips on it.<b></b></p><p>Hair products that you use to make your hair look nice can be doing more damage than you think. As you choose your products, avoid the ones that contain any alcohol. The alcohol will dry your hair out quickly. These products could also dry out your scalp, so avoid any contact with the scalp.</p><p>Always use a great conditioner. When you use a good conditioner, it moisturizes and protects your hair, and adds a lovely shine. When applying conditioner, spread it throughout your hair evenly, but try to avoid the roots if you have particularly oil hair. Always rinse it out thoroughly, as any residue left in your hair will leave it looking dull.</p><p>When split ends become a problem, the only rational thing for you to do, is face reality and trim them off. Although there are products and processes that can allegedly fix split ends, they are temporary solutions at best. Using a harsh product to tame split ends will only damage your hair further. The sooner you can bring yourself to trim your split ends, the faster you can get back to your ideal hair.</p><p>Stay away from over-brushing or over-combing your hair. Also, do not run your fingers through your hair too often. All of these things can damage fragile hair and even, make your hair fall out. Just brush, comb or finger-comb your hair, when it is absolutely necessary for you to do so.</p><p>For the best hair possible, add massaging your scalp into your weekly routine. Massaging your scalp can loosen up and clear out dandruff and increase circulation to your head for optimum hair growth! This does not need to be done daily to be effective, once a week is enough to see great results.</p><p>Hopefully, this gave you the advice you needed and it was easy to follow. You can now use this in your day-to-day routine. Apply some of the things that you've learned here, and notice a positive change to the look and feel of <a href="http://www.mofain.com/">cheap hair weft</a>.</p><p><b>Hair extension</b> is an advanced hair improvement technique that is nowadays used to convert the hair drastically without looking unrealistic. <a href="http://www.mofain.com/">Mofain Hair</a> is a famous online brand and provides you with the service that is found nowhere else.

<p>New Year, new Bundle. Right? We always try to kick off New Year with the best Bundle possible and we think this is one of the best Bundles we have ever put togheter for you.</p><p>As you may know, our very first Bundle in 2014 was named 'Starting 2014 Like a Boss' Bundle and then in 2015 we continuted with this tradition and named our New Year's Bundle as 'Starting 2015 Like a Boss' Bundle. It is only logical that given the new naming scheme, this Bundle should be named 'Bundle 16: Starting 2016 Like a Boss'. However we put extra portion of work into this Bundle which caused us to miss the starting point of the year 2016 in which the Bundle should start.</p><p>In this case we have decided to name our current Bundle as 'Bundle 16: Think Forward'. You may ask, why 'Think Forward'? As you can see there are four Steam Greenlight games which of three will be finished in Q1 2016. We have chosen these games very carefully because we do not Bundle everything that comes around. That said, we 'Think Forward' and find the games that will bring a lot of fun once released.</p><p>List of the games goes:</p><li><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/403180" target="_blank">Draw a Sticman: EPIC 2 (Steam with Trading Cards)</a></li><li><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/434270" target="_blank">Parasite (Steam &amp; itch.io)</a></li><li><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/335550" target="_blank">Cubicity (Steam with Trading Cards)</a></li><li><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/342240" target="_blank">SCHAR: Blue Shield Alliance (Steam with Trading Cards)</a></li><li><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/346630" target="_blank">Plazma Being (Steam with Trading Cards)</a></li><li><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=588037907" target="_blank" title="Link: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=588037907">Cube Destroyer (Steam Greenlight  GREENLIT &amp; itch.io)</a></li><li><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=587935277" target="_blank">Rogue's Federation (Steam Greenlight &amp; itch.io  only demo yet*)</a></li><li><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=588046874" target="_blank">One Step (Steam Greenlight &amp; itch.io  only demo yet*)</a></li><li><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=596376244" target="_blank">Sophie's Curse (Steam Greenlight)</a></li>

<p>like the Amish, the Mennonites, the Hutterites... Among some of these groups, the Hutterites- there are no recorded <a href="http://thedropnet.com/brain-pills/" target="_blank">Brain Pills</a>&nbsp;cases of homicide. During our major wars, like World War II where people <a href="http://thedropnet.com/brain-pills/" target="_blank">Brain Pills</a> were being drafted they would refuse to serve in the military. They would go to prison rather <a href="http://thedropnet.com/brain-pills/" target="_blank" title="Link: http://thedropnet.com/brain-pills/">Brain Pills</a>&nbsp;than serve in the military. In the Kibbutzim in Israel the level of violence is so low <a href="http://thedropnet.com/brain-pills/" target="_blank">Brain Pills</a>&nbsp;that the criminal courts there will often send violent offenders people who have <a href="http://thedropnet.com/brain-pills/" target="_blank">Brain Pills</a>&nbsp;committed crimes- to live on the Kibbutzim in order to learn how to live a non-violent life. Because that's the way people live there. So, we are amply shaped by society. Our societies, in the broader sense, including our theological, our metaphysical, our <a href="http://thedropnet.com/brain-pills/" target="_blank">Brain Pills</a>&nbsp;linguistic influences, etc., our societies help shape us as to whether or not we think life is basically about sin or about beauty;</p><div><a href="http://thedropnet.com/brain-pills/">http://thedropnet.com/brain-pills/</a></div><div><br></div>

<div> <div> <p>Its no secret that paper shuffling consumes more of the doctors  workday than interacting with patients. Between checking the schedule,  writing charts, writing prescriptions, and waiting for tardy patients, a  busy physicians day can become cluttered by tasks that have little to  do with medical practice. Wouldnt it be nice to streamline the chaos  with an efficient telehealth program? Besides allowing doctors to  interact with patients remotely, telemedicine platforms can automate  data collection, enhancing EMRs with instantly captured information  gleaned from patient telemedicine sessions. They can send automated  appointment reminders to patients, cutting the no-show rate and making  better use of a doctors time. And the eHealth services they provide can  drastically reduce paperwork, enabling physicians to focus on actual  patient care. ConnectExpert offers all these features, and its flexible  enough to use with a PC or an iOS system.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Imagine being able to  update an EMR automatically. Rather than putting pen to paper and taking  physical notesnotes that later must be transcribed by a stafferthe  script or recording of a telehealth session is automatically analyzed,  and the files are updated. Its just that easy. Instead of looking at a  paper chart a patient filled in while sitting in the waiting room,  imagine receiving an electronic file containing all the information you  need. Imagine a digital file for each patient in your practice. Imagine  being able to check within each file for possible drug interactions, or a  preexisting condition that may be causing symptoms. It can all be a  reality with ConnectExpert.</p><p>For more information, please, feel free to visit<a target="_blank" href="http://connectexpert.com/features"> http://connectexpert.com/features</a></p><p>Apart  from the reduced paperwork, appointment reminders, and data collection  capabilities, technology enabled care has another key benefit: cutting  out the need for in-office consultation visits. Very often, doctors are  compelled to see patients merely to check-in on their overall state of  health. Theyre being given a primer course before surgery, or advice on  treatment, or a quick follow-up check up. Wouldnt it be nice to  conduct those light appointments remotely? If patient care requires  little more than the ability to communicate, why shouldnt it be done  via a telemedicine platform? In this way, a doctors time in the office  can be used in the most efficient way possible: doing exams, procedures,  and providing hands-on care.</p><p>Contact Info:</p><p>Address: Web CS Limited, 6 St. Davids Square, Westferry Road,</p><p>London, United Kingdom, E14 3WA</p><p>Tel.: +44 (0) 20-351-984-77</p><p>E-mail: info@connectexpert.com</p><p>Facebook:<a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/connectexpert"> https://www.facebook.com/connectexpert</a></p><p>Twitter:<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Connect2Expert"> https://twitter.com/Connect2Expert</a></p><p>Linkedin:<a title="Link: https://www.linkedin.com/company/connect-expert" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/connect-expert"> https://www.linkedin.com/company/connect-expert</a></p><p>Website:<a target="_blank" href="http://connectexpert.com/"> http://connectexpert.com/</a></p> </div> </div><br>

Levis Stadium is one of the most technologically advanced stadiums ever built.<br><br>It features 12,000 network ports, 1,200 access points, 1,700 beacons, and a DAS system, looking to accommodate an audience of 68,500 visitors. The stadiums bandwidth capacity is 40Gbps (4x greater than the NFL stadium mandate put into place in 2015). Fans follow the game on 2,000 IPTVs.<br><br>When Levis Stadium hosts Super Bowl 50 in just a few days, itll bring a new approach to the overall game experience by offering fans network connectivity via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and a number of other digital services.<br><br>But the more connected stadiums become, the more risks they create. Such a concentration of mobile users could entice hackers looking to steal data from high-profile celebrities, politicians, and others at the game. It could allow someone to commandeer the stadiums TV screens. It could allow a hacker to enslave thousands of unsuspecting mobile users with no more than a pockets worth of technology.<br><br>Heres our assessment of the risks smart stadiums create and how venue operators and fans themselves can stay safe.<br><br>The demand for smart stadiums is growing as the list of connected venues expands. Some of the newest include Mercedes Benz Stadium, U.S. Bank Stadium, and SunTrust Park in the U.S. Smart Stadiums are also being built in Rio for the Olympic Games and in Russia for the 2018 FIFA world cup.<br><br>Think of 70,000 people tweeting, posting, and sharing every moment during the game. It will stretch even the best network to the max, forcing telecommunication companies to upgrade the surrounding infrastructure. Fans at last years Super Bowl consumed more than 6 terabytes of data.<br><br>This year fans will stay connected through Levis Stadiums 40Gbps of bandwidth capacity provided by Comcast Business Ethernet, beacon and access points supplied by Aruba Networks, and switching equipment from Barcode.<br><br>Another dimension of the experience is the Levis Stadium mobile app, which lets fans order food to their seats, find the shortest bathroom line, watch real-time replays, and much more.<br><br>Radwares Emergency Response Team (ERT) experts have assessed the Levis Stadium network architecture and have raised several concerns for the venue network operators to take into account.<br><br>Open Wi-Fi networks present one of the biggest attack vectors for network- and malware-based attacks. The risk of your mobile device being hacked in an environment like this grows exponentially with more and more people connecting to the same open Wi-Fi.<br><br>Fake cell phone towers and access points could be deployed as well to intercept and track users. There is even a risk of a denial of service attack leaving fans unable to take advantage of the benefits of a smart stadium.<br><br>Hackers, whether their motives are political, social, or financial, can take advantage of the stadium network to steal personal data such as passwords, emails, and photos.<br><br>Unsecure and vulnerable access points or evil twins could be used to spread malware and mine for data. Hackers may gain sensitive user information through fake pop ups, text messages, or spoofed websites.<br><br>For instance, credit card information could be leaked when fans take advantage of the food ordering feature.<br><br>Last year researchers found the NFL app exposed users personal information via a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack right before the Super Bowl.<br><br>Hackers could also cause game-related issues. During the AFC championship game between the Broncos and Patriots on January 24th, the Patriots experienced network issues with the tablets coaches use to review plays. A hacker could execute such a scheme against either team, knocking out the Wi-Fi used to receive and review plays.<br><br>Additionally, the stadium TVs or national TV live broadcast could be compromised since they too connect to the stadium infrastructure.<br><br>So, what needs to be done?<br><br>Smart stadium and smart venue operators need to regularly review and inspect their network to defend against these threats.<br><br>Investing in smart stadium technology is only the first step. The second is investing to keep it secure. There are two major aspects to this.<br><br>Put in place the right protections before each access point, and protect the whole network from malware. The same applies for protecting application servers.<br><br>Once security is in place, keep it up to date by routinely downloading software upgrades and patches. Conduct audits and penetration testing between events. Use ACL and load balancing.<br><br>Fans attending Super Bowl 50 should take these simple steps to keep their devices and information secure.<br><br>Smart stadiums will offer fans a more connected and enjoyable experience, as long as both fans and stadium operators take care to stay secure.

Escalon, CA, 2/7/16 -&nbsp;<b>Animals Angels, Inc. has documented proof that Escalon Livestock Auction is engaging in shocking animal cruelty, but local officials have refused to prosecute.</b><p><b></b></p><p>On multiple occasions in 2014 and 2015 investigators from Animals Angels witnessed workers at Escalon Auction, one of the states largest auctions, mistreating non-ambulatory cows; including one case of selling a downed animal in violation of the California statute, a botched euthanasia attempt and multiple cases of letting downer cows suffer for hours and die without assistance. All cases were also in violation of a humane treatment plan the auction agreed to in 2009.</p><p>Animals Angels also contends that there were clear violations of California Penal Code Section 599f(d), which requires immediate action to humanely euthanize downed animals and Section 599f(e), which prohibits dragging non-ambulatory animals, as well as multiple violations of Section 597, Californias general anti-cruelty prohibitions.</p><p>These are serious violations of the California Penal Code, and they came to light during open visits to the Escalon Livestock Auctions facility, said Sonja Meadows, President of Animals Animals. What is most telling is that the criminal activity occurs out in the open, showing Escalon Auctions belief that it is above the law.</p><p>During investigations in 2008 and 2009 members of Animals Angels documented numerous instances of blatant animal cruelty and animal welfare violations. In 2009 the group, in conjunction with representatives of the California Farm Bureau, the State Veterinarian, the Livestock Marketing Association, and the California Cattlemen Association and Escalon Auction management, discussed the findings of its investigations and developed a plan to improve conditions for the animals to be sold. The auction also agreed to hire a person to monitor the welfare of the animals. </p><p>Between 2010 and 2013, conditions seemed to be improving, but on a return investigation in 2014, Animals Angels documented further cases of flagrant mistreatment and horrific crueltyall in violation of the agreed-upon treatment plan as well as California law. </p><p>In August 2014, Animals Angels found shocking abuse of several animals at the Escalon Auction  and perhaps more importantly, the complete indifference of the individuals responsible for ensuring humane treatment.  For example  investigators documented the condition of non-ambulatory cows who, rather than being humanely euthanized as required by law, were instead dumped callously next to manure piles or left lying on asphalt, exposed to the full heat of the sun for hours to suffer horribly and die.</p><p>Animals Angels once again presented their findings to the San Joaquin County Sheriffs Office. The San Joaquins Sheriffs Office investigated, but the countys District Attorneys Office again declined to press charges, saying that the auction had agreed to a new set of guidelines and promised to once more improve its treatment of the animals under its care.</p><p>That seems to be an empty promise, Sonja Meadows said. The Auctions return to the same illegal conduct that it had engaged in previously demonstrates that nothing short of prosecution will have any lasting effect on the animal cruelty that appears to have become standard operating procedure at Escalon.</p><p>Animals Angels latest investigation found appalling violations during three separate visits to the Escalon Auction in July and August 2015.</p><p>On July 10, 2015, investigators witnessed auction workers violently pulling on the ear and then hind leg of a non-ambulatory calf in a cruel effort to make her move. Despite the fact that the workers were unable to get the calf to rise or walk, she was sold shortly after, and then loaded into the buyers truck.</p><p>California Penal Code Section 599f(a) states: No slaughterhouse, stockyard, auction, market agency, or dealer shall buy, sell, or receive a non-ambulatory animal.</p><p>On Aug. 5, 2015, investigators watched a non-ambulatory dairy cow unloaded from a trailer. The cow struggled to rise to its feet, but was unable to do so. The driver of the truck that had delivered the cow, along with an Escalon Auction employee, used an electric cattle prod in an apparent attempt to get her to stand, and when that didnt work, kicked her as well. </p><p>When their efforts to force her to rise proved futile, the auction worker attempted to shoot the cow, but failed to check whether the device had really killed the animal. When the forks of the Bobcat being used to move the cow touched her, she reacted violently and began to struggle. Because of a gate blocking their view, investigators were unable to see what followed, but they believe the gun was used a second time. The motionless cow was then loaded onto the Bobcats forks and dumped in the back of the premises.</p><p>This single incident, the treatment this one cow received before she was finally killed, includes several violations of Californias general anti-cruelty statute, commented Sonja Meadows. No animal should have to suffer what she endured before she died, and California law clearly prohibits this very type of treatment.</p><p>On Aug. 7, 2015, investigators saw a non-ambulatory Holstein bull calf that was clearly taking rapid, shallow breaths.  An auction worker dragged the calf to an area outside the livestock pens and left the calf on top of a garden hose, where the animal remained, vocalizing and struggling, for three hours. During that time auction workers stepped over the calf, and one even struck the calf with a paddle. It wasnt until the auctions barn manager saw Animals Angels investigators filming that action was taken. A worker started to lift the animal by the skin on the calfs back before being told to carry it, most likely because investigators were filming.  The calf was put in the bucket of a Bobcat and taken away. </p><p>This documented incident again involved clear violations of California laws, explained Meadows, including Californias anti-cruelty statutes. </p><p>On Sept. 14, 2015, Animals Angels submitted the extensive evidence investigators had gathered to the San Joaquin County District Attorneys Office, and urged them once again to take this continued, egregious animal abuse seriously. </p><p>To date, the San Joaquin County District Attorneys Office has done nothing, Meadows continued. No charges have been filed against Escalon Auction and thousands of animals passing through the sale every week continue to suffer.</p><p>The acts that Animals' Angels documented, including other violations of California law, show that the auction is continuing to engage in unacceptable, cruel, illegal behavior. </p><p>According to Sonja Meadows, If our investigators were able to see this much in only three visits, its clear the only way to possibly trigger a change in behavior, and the only way to improve the treatment of the animals at Escalon Auction, is to press criminal charges for these continued violations.</p><p>In response to the continuing outrages against basic decency, not to mention the well-documented recurring criminal behavior by Escalon Livestock Auction, as well as the ongoing unresponsiveness of the San Joaquin County District Attorneys Office, Animals Angels is asking the public to contact the District Attorneys Office and ask them to press charges. The Office can be reached by phone at (209) 468-2400 or by mailing letters to 222 E. Weber Avenue, Second Floor, Room 202, Stockton, CA 95202.</p><p>Were not done with this fight, Meadows said. We are going to continue to push for something to be done to ensure that animals are no longer mistreated at Escalon Auction. Its clear that non-enforceable, voluntary agreements are simply not enough. The San Joaquin County District Attorneys Office must file criminal charges if anything is going to change.</p><p><b>To see the <u>video</u> from the Animals Angels investigation, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxazXXUGP8w&amp;feature=youtu.be">go here</a>. </b><b><br></b></p><p><b> To read the full, detailed Animals Angels investigation, <a href="http://www.animalsangels.org/investigations/cows-cattle/escalon-livestock-auction-compilation-report">go here</a>.</b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b></b></p><div><iframe frameborder="0" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/hxazXXUGP8w" width="560" height="315"></iframe></div><b><div><b><br></b></div></b><p><b><i></i>About Animals' Angels, Inc:</b><br> Animals' Angels Inc. is a 501 (c)(3) non-profit organization incorporated in Maryland with full-time investigators working in the United States.</p><p> Our focus is on fighting animal cruelty and improving conditions for farm animals through investigations, public awareness campaigns, and education.<i></i></p><i>  </i><p><b><i></i>Contact:<br> </b>Sonja Meadows, President<b><br> </b><a href="mailto:info@animalsangels.org" title="Link: mailto:info@animalsangels.org">info@animalsangels.org</a><b><br> </b>443-821-3343<i></i></p><p><img alt="" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/robin8-production/robin8-production/27f22b44-9193-40db-beb4-9290a6b87ec5/AAclearlogo.png" title="Image https3amazonawscomrobin8-productionrobin8-production27f22b44-9193-40db-beb4-9290a6b87ec5AAclearlogopng"><br></p><p></p><p><b><br> <br> </b></p>

These techniques were actually obtained from the primordial time. Vashikaran Spells had also been used by our ancestors. </p>  <p>But, resorting to Vashikaran requires the help of an expert in this regard who is called or referred to as a Vashikaran specialist.

I didnt have to talk to my friends and family, Lopez said.</b></p><p><b>Nicole joined the MLM world hoping to work from her modest condominium in Springville. Her little boy was a newborn, and she wanted to be home with him and the other children she hoped to have. At the same time, she knew that the family needed the second income she earned as an office manager.</b></p><p><b>Still, she didnt want her personal life to turn into a series of potential sales meetings. She feared the same thing would happen to her that happened to Jon Taylor when he spent a year selling products for Utahs largest MLM, Nu Skin.</b></p><p><b>It was affecting all of our relationships, everybody within three feet of you is a prospect, and so people were avoiding us, Taylor said, describing a conversation in which his wife demanded he stop.</b></p><p><b>Both Herbalife and Nu Skin provided FOX 13 with written statements saying their companies do not employ high-pressure tactics and abide by strict ethical guidelines.</b></p><p><b>For Nicole, though, the pressure felt intense. She had several people in what is called her upline, a term describing the distributors who benefit from Nicoles sales and recruiting, in a growing team.</b></p><p><b>It was an all or nothing thing for me because I thought, 'Either I'm going to do this fast and replace my income, or I'm going to have two jobs that I'm working,'" Lopez said.</b></p><p><b>Lopez found herself getting deeper in debt: A thousand dollars for a packet of sales leads, a couple thousand a month in product to sell so she could start making commission checks.

The clear conclusion is that most people dont make a commission and a very few people advance to the highest levels that lead to incomes that might replace a good, full-time job.</b></p><p><b>Going into it with that in mind though, we found people who love their Multi-Level experience and feel like it rejuvenated their lives at home and work (which is largely at home.)</b></p><p><b>Exhibit 1: Laura and Spencer Pettit. The Pettits started using doTerra oils as a favor to friends who had just started as Wellness Advocates (doTerras term for independent distributors.)</b></p><p><b>"It took me months before I would even admit to people that I was doing multilevel marketing, said Spencer, sitting next to his wife on a couch in the office building on doTerras expansive Pleasant Grove campus.</b></p><p><b>It may have taken months to admit it, but the Pettits also report it took just months to replace the income Spencer had been making as a marketing director with a local company.</b></p><p><b>The Pettits describe the change as a Godsend, giving them a career where they feel like they are helping people get healthier physically, spiritually and financially.</b></p><p><b>And Laura says the first life they saw transformed was their own.</b></p><p><b>He worked 15, 16, 17 hours a day.

Hes a devout Mormon himself.</b></p><p><b>Nicole Lopez, the former Herbalife distributor, talked about the prevalence of stay at home mothers. Utah has more than any other state, sharing the distinction with Arizona according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</b></p><p><b>Spencer and Laura Pettit talk about the Green Jello Belt of communities in the Intermountain West that foster entrepreneurial attitudes, a strong work ethic, and openness to natural products.</b><b></b></p></h1>
<p>Plans by central Kenya governors to sideline established marketers and sell coffee directly kicked up a storm in the market sometime last year. For a sector that has been on steady decline for two decades, the decision was sure to excite the market. It is desirable that farmers earn more. Small-scale producers have endured slave prices for long. The average pay for small-scale farmers in Kenya has been Sh15,000 annually in the last 10 years. But a family of six in coffee-growing areas needs a minimum of Sh150,000 per year to survive. Any effort to shield producers from perennial price shocks would be more than welcome. However, such efforts should be informed by a deep understanding of market operations. This is important because Kenyan coffee enjoys a unique position in the globe. The law allows the counties to organise agricultural production and marketing. But there is a difference between law and reality, fact and fiction. The law is an ass. Reality is a dictator. By now, the good governors have hopefully learnt the basic facts about the market chain. Politics aside: The main challenges facing the sector are: Price and exchange rate fluctuations, access to finance, poor extension services, inadequate research/development, poor organisation of farmers, weak marketing regulatory systems and infrastructure, increasing poverty in rural areas, rising costs of production, low productivity and climate change, as well as lack of farming interest by the youthful generation. To see what is at stake here, lets look at the market structure. The coffee market is not like selling onions at Karatina market. But there is one similarity. Both supply chains are controlled by vampire-brokers and traders. All markets have a fair share of these. There are three coffee marketing systems: The traditional market, fair trade and direct coffee trade. Kenya uses the traditional system. After the auction in Nairobi, the coffee ends up in the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange (CSCE) where most Arabica coffee is sold. In the market, Kenyan coffee is Colombia Mild (C) type and fetches a premium price. Most Robusta coffee, the kind grown in Uganda (called Brazilian Naturals) is traded at the London International Financial Futures and Options (LIFFE). It is inferior, market-wise. This system is much criticised as detached, heartless with little interest in the welfare of the farmers. The value chain is dominated by four companies; Nestlé, Kraft Foods, Sara Lee and a few big coffee roasters like Smuckers, Strauss, Starbucks and Tchibo. Together, these influence significantly the overall coffee demand and supply! Large roasters do not deal with farmers directly but rely on traders for supply. In Kenya, large trading companies include Neumann Gruppe (Germany), Volcafé (Switzerland) and ECOM (Switzerland). These three companies trade 50 per cent of the worlds green coffee. Trouble is, traders have vast market knowledge and cant be wished away one morning.<br>The sheer hegemony of these corporates has fuelled a search for an alternative, fairer and direct trade system. The fair-trade system promises a framework that changes producers relationship with the market by linking them directly to consumers or consumer organisations. But a plethora of certification programmes, little change in prices, and the inability of farmers to meet standards set by fair-trade organisations is causing great confusion. For our good governors, it is important to note that the direct coffee trade they have promised farmers is just emerging, too vague and structurally weak. It faces standards enforcement problems. The governors should find out how Jamaica successfully branded its Blue Mountain Coffee without kicking a tantrum with local cartels. Jamaican coffee is doing well in Japan. The governors should look for ways to motivate farmers to take care of their bushes, especially currently when demand outstrips supply. Reports say the market will soon experience a supply crisis last seen in the 1970s due to the current severe drought and bad weather in Brazil and Vietnam. Kenyan coffee has a comparative advantage and should have no problem if it is well marketed. Lastly, it is time we promoted the local market. There is a lot of potential in the instant coffee segment among the ballooning middle class. Just look at the coffee shops popping up in Nairobi.<br></p>

<p>DALLAS, TEXAS (Feb. 9, 2016)Nothing says true love like barbeque. Valentines Day is the perfect time to spread the love with your favorite barbeque mate. Soulmans Bar-B-Que CEO Brett Randle shares tips behind the perfect pairings of meat and sides. Our sides run the gamut from sweet and silky to salty and crunchy. While the combinations seem endless, we have found that some make our customers fall in love over and over again.</p><p>A beautiful slab of brisket can bring tears to any young lovers eyes, but add a side of green beans that packs a punch and the creamy deliciousness of mac and cheese, and your dance card  and plate  will be full.</p><p>Fall-off-the-bone ribs are fantastic on their own. But, when served with sides of Texas toast and coleslaw, with its acidic and refreshing bite to cut the heaviness of the meat, you have the ideal balance of flavors. This is always important to any relationship.</p><p>Pulled pork as a sandwich cant be beat when a side of fresh-cut French fries is added. French fries, the Clark Kent of potatoes, can transition into Superman with the swift sopping up of the perfect barbeque sauce.</p><p>Simultaneously hearty and refreshing, potato salad partners deliciously with hickory-smoked chicken. These two down-home tastes always satisfy. Add spicy cream corn, and you have a flavor feast.</p><p>Alongside beef brisket, ham, hot links, sausage, turkey,&nbsp;chicken, pulled pork and  the crowd favorite  ribs, Soulmans serves hearty helpings of homemade sides year-round. Brett explains, "For more than 41 years now, our sides have been an important part of our business and what distinguishes Soulman's from the pack.  Carefully crafted by the founders mother before the first location opened, they remain one of the reasons our fans have loved Soulman's BBQ since 1974."</p><p><b>About Soulmans Bar-B-Que</b></p><p>For more than 40 years, Soulman's Bar-B-Que has satisfied the hardest to please barbecue lovers...Texans!

<p><b>Ignoring heart attacks is a fatal mistake for thousands, says Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care</b></p><p>PLANO, TEXAS (Feb. 10, 2016)  Every 34 seconds, someone in the United States has a heart attack, and 22,200 of those people die because they didnt recognize the signs of what was happening to them. According to the <a href="http://www.heart.org/idc/groups/ahamah-public/@wcm/@sop/@smd/documents/downloadable/ucm_480086.pdf">American Heart Association</a>, 370,000 people die of heart disease every year, but tens of thousands of them could easily be saved if they had just known what to look for and what to do.</p><p>Too many people ignore heart issues. We have heard every excuse there is for not coming to the ER sooner. Patients have been known to say things like I thought it was just indigestion or I dont have the time right now or I thought it could wait, says Dr. Jay Woody, co-founder of <a href="http://www.legacyer.com/">Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care</a>, a 24/7 emergency and urgent care medical services center with locations throughout North Texas. Its important to see a doctor even if people are unsure that they are having a heart issue.</p><p>Even though its better to be safe than sorry, many people still find reasons not to go to the doctor:</p><p>1.&nbsp;<b>I dont know where to go: </b>This is more common than expected. Many people dont know if they require an emergency room visit, an urgent care or if their primary doctor should first see them.</p><p>At the end of the day, if patients are experiencing heart attack symptoms (tightness in chest, pain in the left arm, dizziness or irregular heartbeat), its important to get checked as soon as they can before the symptoms escalate to major problems<b>. </b>At Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care, board certified physicians make a diagnosis based on the symptoms and condition of a patient.</p><p>Many people dont realize that Legacy has a fully equipped emergency room ready to handle patients dealing with a heart problem, Woody explains. We have ER certified doctors, a lab to do blood work, ultrasound machines, X-rays, EKGs and CT scanners to test for heart issues  we have the same equipment in our ER as you would find in a hospital-attached ER.</p><p>2.&nbsp;<b>I cant afford it</b><b>:</b> Many people say its too expensive and they dont have the resources for an emergency room visit.</p><p>A vast majority of Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care patients have what can be classified as urgent care needs, where lower charges apply. Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care strives for complete transparency and lets its patients know where their diagnosis fits ahead of time. Why is this important, besides being ethically responsible? Walk-in ERs and hospital emergency rooms can only bill one way; every visit is an emergency visit. Using its hybrid healthcare model, Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Cares physicians review the heart issue and determine if the patient needs to be treated as an emergency room patient or as an urgent care patient. This unique model allows patients to only pay for the care they receive and results in over $1,800 in savings per visit over a Free Standing Emergency Room.</p><p>3.&nbsp;<b>I dont have time right now</b><b>:</b> Modern day schedules are packed from the moment people wake up to the moment they fall asleep. Unless the pain or illness is unbearable, many people think they just dont have the time to go to the doctor, or they fear that they will sit around in a waiting room for hours waiting to be seen.</p><p>Appointments are not necessary at Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care, and online check-in means people can even bypass paperwork when they arrive. Most patients wait less than five minutes to see the board certified physician and are typically heading home in less than 30 minutes.</p><p>4.&nbsp;<b>I dont want to be lectured</b><b>:</b> Many are afraid of being judged. Maybe they are overweight or smoke or drink too much and dont want a healthy living lecture.</p><p>Physicians see patients at their most vulnerable time. Find a hospital, emergency room or urgent care center where customer service is part of the key values. Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care has an exceptional customer service rating comparable to the best retailers and hospitality groups in the country. Imagine that  local healthcare has a new standard for the patient experience.</p><p>5.&nbsp;<b>Im afraid</b><b>:</b> There is always fear of the unknown. Patients can get fearful when visiting the doctor, especially if they know something is wrong but dont know exactly what it is.&nbsp;</p><p>Catching heart disease or even a heart attack early saves lives. The simple truth is this  more than 370,000 Americans die every year because they did not get help in time.</p><p>6.&nbsp;<b>Its not a heart attack, its something else</b><b>:</b> They know something is wrong but they are in denial. Lets face it<b> </b> as much as a quarter of the U.S. population experiences chest pain that is not related to the heart. But, it only takes once for a heart attack symptom to become fatal.</p><p>&nbsp;We really want to encourage people to see a doctor if they have any clue something is wrong, says Woody. When it comes to the heart, every minute counts. And Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care is here to help make that doctor visit as quick, easy and painless as possible.</p><p>Founded in 2008, Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care is one of the nations first health care models to offer both urgent care and emergency room treatment options under one roof. It has built an exceptional customer service program and rating by providing transparent billing, soothing environments and one-on-one service with board-certified, emergency-trained physicians. Patients have access to immediate, on-site emergency room equipment and only pay emergency care prices when it is truly an emergency.</p><p>For more information, visit <a href="http://legacyer.com/" title="Link: http://legacyer.com/">http://legacyer.com/</a>, <a title="Link: null">facebook.com/LegacyERandUrgentCare</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/legacyertx" title="Link: https://twitter.com/legacyertx">twitter.com/legacyertx</a>.</p><p>###</p><p><b>Media Contacts:</b></p><p>Stephen Fashoro</p><p>TrizCom PR</p><p>O: 972-247-1369</p><p>C: 469-628-6471</p><p><a href="mailto:Stephen@trizcom.com">Stephen@trizcom.com</a></p><p><br></p><p>Nikki Darling<br></p><p>TrizCom PR</p><p>O: 972-247-1369</p><p><a title="Link: null">Nikki@trizcom.com</a></p><p><b>Legacy ER &amp; Urgent Care Locations:</b></p><p>1310 W.

<p>IEEE, the world's largest professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for humanity, today announced the release of its latest report, <i>WearFit: Security Design Analysis of a Wearable Fitness Tracker. </i>This report showcases the 10 common security design flaws using a security analysis of a fictitious wearable fitness tracking system called WearFit. The flaws examined build upon the work originally introduced by the IEEE Center for Secure Design in 2014 in the report <a href="http://bit.ly/SWSECFlaws"><i>Avoiding the Top 10 Software Security Design Flaws</i></a><i>.</i></p><p>Adoption of connected devices including cars, appliances and wearables that make up the Internet of Things (IoT) is growing rapidly. Industry analysts report that nearly half of the population is expected to use wearable fitness-tracking devices by 2019. The form factor of devices like WearFit that connect people with other devices represents a new way that society is consuming computing technology, which makes wearables a high-priority area to scrutinize for potential software security threats.</p><p>While a fictitious product, the WearFit design was based on real-world systems including the device architecture and its various components, each of which expose potential attack surfaces  at the device, the mobile application, the website and in transit between those different platforms. <i>WearFit: Security Design Analysis of a Wearable Fitness Tracker </i>first describes how the WearFit device is designed at a functional level, independent of security, and then applies each of the 10 flaws in a detailed analysis of the WearFit design.</p><p>Broadly speaking, security is a real concern whenever technology is involved. While concern shouldnt prevent the adoption of technology, we hope that by reading this design analysis, consumers get a broad view of the kinds of attacks that could impact a wearable fitness tracker and the good design decisions that can prevent them from succeeding. For security professionals, we highlight the importance of building security in from the design of the software all the way through the development and testing until it is eventually operated or sent to a user, said Jacob West, founding member of the IEEE Center for Secure Design and chief architect, Security Products at NetSuite. With <i>WearFit: Security Design Analysis of a Wearable Fitness Tracker</i>, our goal is to expand the focus to include a balanced approach that looks at design flaws and identifies ways that manufacturers can avoid vulnerabilities and bugs by the nature of the way the device is built.</p><p>                                   </p><p>The IEEE Center for Secure Design is managed by the IEEE Cybersecurity Initiative that aims to shape and lead a technical agenda by providing tools for computer security education, guidance on secure software coding and software assurance engineering. The IEEE Cybersecurity Initiative is a program of the <a href="http://www.ieee.org/futuredirections" title="Link: http://www.ieee.org/futuredirections">IEEE Future Directions Committee</a>, designed to develop and share educational tools, events and content for emerging technologies.

<p>Hoverboards are pretty cool, but these misnomers on wheels have been running into trouble lately. Some have been spontaneously combusting  one may have even <a href="http://kdvr.com/2015/12/01/exploding-hoverboard-blamed-for-destroying-louisiana-familys-home/" target="_blank">committed arson</a>. Others have been making riders faceplant with disconcerting regularity (though some of that could be chalked up to riders ineptitude). One even managed to put&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACGeWm8dcu8" target="_blank">Mike Tysons backside on the mat</a>&nbsp;in about 30 seconds, which is a lot quicker than Buster Douglas or Lennox Lewis managed to do it.</p><p>The entire fiasco has meant rideables are quite in at the moment, but the opportunity exists to dethrone hoverboards as the most popular gadget in the segment. If&nbsp;<a href="http://www.leiftech.com/" target="_blank">LeifTech</a>&nbsp;has its way, electric skateboards may take over as our futuristic transportation of choice.</p><div><iframe frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1lz9RFPSrX0?rel=0" width="640" height="360"></iframe></div><p>The whole idea behind Leifs electric skateboard is to bring the experience of snowboarding to places that dont see any snowfall, because lots of people miss snowboarding in the off-season and some just never get to try it. Leif does this by making the skateboard like a remote-controlled car, with the remote being in the riders hands, of course.</p><p>Analogous to the wheels on a remote-controlled car are the two 360-degree rotating battery-powered caster wheels that accompany the standard wheels on the skateboard. In order to recreate the feeling of tearing down a freshly-groomed moutain slope on asphalt, the eSnowboard, as they call it, has a rotating plate powered by a 2000-watt electric motor which ensures a smooth ride with each turn.</p><p>Riders dictate the speed at which they move with the help of a wireless remote control that connects with the skateboard via Bluetooth. The board can hit speeds of up to 23 mph, which doesnt come close to how fast snowboards can go, but this is more about the feel of the ride than the speed.</p><p><img width="1403" alt="electric snowboard remote control from Leiftech " src="http://www.snapmunk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/leif-tech-skateboard-remote-control.jpg" height="776" title="Image: http://www.snapmunk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/leif-tech-skateboard-remote-control.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Leif electric skateboards ability to mimic snowboarding is as much a result of the software thats packed into it as it is the hardware. Theres a CPU positioned in the centre of the underbody which controls the electric motor on each caster wheel. Using inputs from sensors and algorithms, it distributes power dynamically between the wheels during high-speed turns and tight carves.</p><p><img width="1403" alt="Leiftechs electronic snowboard features" src="http://www.snapmunk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/leif-tech-electric-skateboard-motor-assembly-snapmunk.jpg" height="873" title="Image: http://www.snapmunk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/leif-tech-electric-skateboard-motor-assembly-snapmunk.jpg"></p><p><img width="1403" alt=" traction control on Leiftechs electronic skateboard" src="http://www.snapmunk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/leiftech-esnowboard-traction-control-snapmunk.jpg" height="407" title="Image: http://www.snapmunk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/leiftech-esnowboard-traction-control-snapmunk.jpg"></p><p>The lithium-phosphate battery pack that powers the electric skateboard runs up to 8 miles on a single charge, though that may vary based on the riding style and terrain; recharging them can take up to 90 minutes. The board weighs 18 pounds, which is slightly heavier than the average skateboard.</p><p>It took a couple of tries for Leif to raise funds for this project. Their Kickstarter campaign fell more than $50,000 short of its $90,000 goal. They then gave it a spin on Indiegogo with half of the previous funding goal. On that second attempt they manged to accumulate 148% of their $45,000 and avoided having to try their luck with GoFundMe.</p><p>More than a year after their crowdfunding campaign closed and many delays later, Leif is finally ready to ship units of its electric skateboard in March. The boards are available for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.leiftech.com/product/leif/" target="_blank" title="Link: http://www.leiftech.com/product/leif/">pre-order on the website</a>&nbsp;for about $1,500, along with accessories such as batteries, chargers, and timing belts. When you order, you have the option to choose between three different wheel colors and three different board lengths.</p>

<p>November 6, 2013: Renowned New York City hairdresser, Sam Brocato, is literally smoothing the world of hair styling with the Brocato VibrastraitTM Oscillating Flat Iron. The extraordinary technology involved in this advanced piece of hair design equipment combines the drying properties of heat with over 7,500 oscillations per minute to smooth and shape all hair textures, while reducing styling and drying time by up to 30%. </p><p>As a busy upscale hairstylist, Brocato said that he and his team are constantly trying to improve and speed up the process of straightening hair without damaging the hair itself. Finding nothing that met his exacting specifications, he worked with a team to develop a safe, new approach. The addition of the unique vibrating sensation allows the VibrastraitTM to easily and quickly glide through the hair, instead of tugging or pulling at it. The vibrating effect can be turned on and off for different styling outcomes. </p><p>While the heat and oscillating properties dry hair and remove kinks and creases, the tourmaline ceramic plates seal in moisture, keeping hair silky smooth for days. The Nano- Silver coated plates do not groove even after repetitive uses, which means the Vibrastrait plates will maintain their slip for years. </p><p>A digital display indicates the exact temperature of the VibrastraitTM. Variable temperature settings allow for more precise control because they can be adjusted for fragile to thick coarse hair. An Integrated Super Sensor Technology enables rapid heat-up and cool-down capabilities, with heat evenly distributed throughout the plates, allowing for even penetration. Additional features include the industrys fastest recovery time, an automatic safety shut-off, an ergonomic design for easy handling, and a three year warranty. </p><p>This revolutionary flat iron has been extensively tested by the thirty members of my Brocato Design Team with transformational results for our clients, said Brocato. Heat penetration is important to the effectiveness of hair products used; conditioner responds especially well to heat. The vibrating quality makes stacked hair become smooth and even, so the flat iron can glide through it more easily. I recommend starting at the scalp and working your way down twice for sleek, luxurious, shiny hair. </p><p>Brocato has been honored as "World Top Fashion Hairstylist" by the World Hairdressing Congress in London and as "Editorial Stylist of the Year at the North American Hairstyling Awards. As the author of Beautiful Business, he shares his thoughts and visions on retailing in the salon industry. </p><p>Available for purchase on <a href="http://www.supersilk.us">www.supersilk.us</a>, <a href="http://www.ulta.com">www.ulta.com</a>, <a href="http://www.folica.com">www.folica.com</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>                               </p><p><img alt="" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/robin8-production/robin8-production/077be8bf-c596-4ccd-a9ed-5df0f01a32d7/VIBRAstraitIron1PURPLEUpD1.png" title="Image https3amazonawscomrobin8-productionrobin8-production077be8bf-c596-4ccd-a9ed-5df0f01a32d7VIBRAstraitIron1PURPLEUpD1png"><br></p>

Changing market dynamics, increasing digitization and changing consumer preferences have all necessitated a different approach from businesses in India. Senior executives and managers have also recognized the change unfolding around them. In order to make sure that they are on top of their game, more and more professionals are opting for executive education programs in the country.</p><p>Now, executive education in India has witnessed a resurgence of late. While management development programs and part-time business courses have always kept the working folks interested, it is only in the last few years that professionals are willingly quitting their high paying jobs and investing their time in the market. Not only does an executive education program freshen their knowledge and enhance their skills, it also give them a chance to try out something new and reorient their career towards a differentpath.</p><p>There are a slew of executive education programs in the market. Top Indian b-schools, international schools and even some corporate firms have developed programs aimed at the working executive. Typically, executive education in India is offered in the following formats:</p><p>Full-time executive masters program  If money and time is not an issue, this is the most immersive of all executive education programs. Typically lasting between 12-15 months, managers usually take a sabbatical and pursue this program. You can reap rich dividends since you are fully invested in the course. You can choose from government institutions like IIM Ahmedabad, private options like SP Jain Institute of Management and Research, Mumbai or global options like MISB Bocconi, Mumbai.&nbsp; </p><p>Part-time executive MBA program  These executive programs are ideally suited for those who cannot quit their current jobs but are interested in upping their skills. Classes are typically held on the weekends. Indian School of Business (ISB), Hyderabad offers an interesting program called PGPMAX in this category.</p><p>Online programs  A computer or mobile device coupled with a decent internet connection is all it takes for access to online executive management programs. Many leading business schools like IIFT and XLRI offer such programs in India. </p><p>            </p><p>Short programs  Lasting from 4 days to a few weeks, these programs offer deeper insights into one specific management area. These offer a great way to stay engaged with the latest trends in your work area. Most of the IIMs and other business schools offer a lot of quality short executive courses. <a href="http://www.misbbocconi.com" target="_blank">Business Schools in India</a></p>

Rolling out a self-service password reset solution requires hard work. Not only do you need to worry about the nuts and bolts of the implementation, but also create an effective communication plan to get everyone on board. And this is where the challenge comes in  getting end-users to adopt a new solution.<br><br>If you build it, they will come?<br><br>This mentality is why many IT initiatives have failed  only 37% of the financial potential of a new initiative is realized due to defects and breakdowns in the implementation phase, according to this study by project management consulting company.

Stockholm  February 3, 2016. Specops Software announced today a new release of&nbsp;Specops uReset with support for forced enrollment and enhanced reporting functionality to allow IT administrators to easily increase enrollment levels.<br><br>Self-service password reset solutions provide measurable benefits by reducing password reset calls to the helpdesk, says Thorbjörn Sjövold, CTO of Specops Software.&nbsp; However IT departments still struggle to meet ROI goals due to poor end-user adoption rates. If end-users are not enrolled in the system they will continue to call the helpdesk.<br><br>Specops uReset provides several key features to deal with this challenge including pre-enrollment, admin enrollment and now forced enrollment options. Pre-enrollment can be achieved by selecting any of the identity services that utilize common Active Directory (AD) user profile information such as: manager details or mobile number. Admin enrollment can be used when the user profile data does not exist in AD using basic PowerShell scripting and out-of-the-box cmdlets to fill this data.<br><br>If pre-enrollment or admin enrollment are not feasible, now IT departments can set forced enrollment options to ensure that end-users enroll. These options include: opening up a browser at login or flexible intervals or opening up a full screen un-closable browser to force enrollment. These options along with the ability to drill down to see which users havent enrolled allow IT departments to tackle this issue effectively.<br><br>Specops uReset pre-enrollment and admin enrollment options are being used with great success allowing our customers to reach 100% adoption rates from day one, continues Sjövold. Now with the introduction of new forced enrollment and user based reporting functions, Specops uReset now allows IT administrators to pin point users that havent enrolled and literally force them to take action.<br><br>For more information on Specops uReset and how it can guarantee 100% end-user adoption, start you free evaluation trial today.<br><br>Specops uReset&nbsp;is the next generation password reset solution by Specops Software.

In the final Democratic debate before the Nevada caucuses, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders faced off at a pivotal moment in the race for the Democratic nomination.<br><br>After a sweeping loss in the New Hampshire primary earlier this week, the former Secretary of State aimed to stop the bleeding. Meanwhile, Sanders needed to generate more momentum and support from non-white voters as he heads to more moderate, diverse states.<br><br>The Democratic presidential candidates turn to Nevada next Saturday, where each candidate needs to take a stand.<br><br>Here are five moments that mattered from the Democratic debate:<br><br>1. Whose Line Is It Anyway?<br><br>Over and over Bernie Sanders hammers home his one message: The economy is rigged and money corrupts politics. And tonight, Clinton stole it from him.<br><br>"There aren't enough good paying jobs, especially for young people. And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top, she said during her opening remarks, echoing the Vermont Senator almost word-for-word from his stump speech.<br><br>Clinton also dropped the R word during her concession speech in New Hampshire on Tuesday.<br><br>While imitation is the biggest form of flattery, it might also be the biggest sign that the once-presumed Democratic frontrunner is scrambling to find a new message.<br><br>2. History on the Stage<br><br>Hillary Clinton was asked tonight about the 55 percent of female voters supporting Bernie Sanders over the former Secretary of State in New Hampshire and what women are "missing" about her. She answered that she has "spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me."<br><br>She then took the opportunity to note some history on the stage:<br><br>"I would note just for an historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates. And this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage," she said referring to herself and moderators PBS's Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff. "So you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it."<br><br>Woodruff quipped: "Senator Sanders, you're in the minority but we still want to hear from you."<br><br>The Vermont Senator -- who would be the first Jewish president -- noted, "I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment as well."<br><br>3. Sanders Takes On Race Relations<br><br>Bernie Sanders made two unequivocal statements on race tonight. First, this -- We are looking at institutional racism, the Vermont Senator declared, citing incarceration rates, youth unemployment, and systemic poverty along racial lines.<br><br>Sanders, who desperately needs to close the gap and improve his name recognition with African American and other minority voters as he race for the partys nomination moves beyond Iowa and New Hampshire, then went further.<br><br>Asked point blank if race relations would be better under a Sanders administration, he did not hesitate, Yes.<br><br>What we will do is say instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners. We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education, he continued.<br><br>4. Bernies Fight Over Fundraising<br><br>Its no surprise that Sanders brought up a corrupt campaign finance system where extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to super PACs.<br><br><br><br>After he implied Clintons super PAC does not allow her to remain independent from corporations who donate large sums of money to her campaign, Clinton said, We are mixing apples and oranges. My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations. I'm very proud.<br><br>Clinton then reminisced about how President Obama was able to stand up to Wall Street even though he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the democratic side ever. That did not settle well with Sanders.<br><br>Let's not insult the intelligence of the American people, Sanders said. People aren't dumb. Why in god's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions? I guess just for the fun of it.<br><br>5. Kissing Off Kissinger<br><br>After criticizing Clintons Iraq War vote, Sanders turned to attacking Clintons relationship with Henry Kissinger, whom Sanders called one of the most destructive secretaries of state.<br><br>In her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger, Sanders said. ...I'm proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend. I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.<br><br>Well, I know journalists have asked who you do listen to on foreign policy and we have yet to know who that is, Clinton pointed out.<br><br>Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger, that's for sure, Sanders fired back.
Employer-based health insurance isn't about to disappear. But its erosion will continue and could eventually reach a tipping point.There are between 150 million and 160 million Americans who depend on employer-based coverage. That's less than half the U.S. population, a share that will gradually shrink over the next decade for several reasons.First, small-business employers with skimpy plans for their lower-wage workers will eventually begin encouraging their employees to seek coverage on the exchanges . They will do so because their existing plans must meet the Affordable Care Act's essential benefit package in 2017.Second, group health insurance among larger employers is rapidly moving toward the more skin in the game model. Nearly a quarter of beneficiaries are in high-deductible plans. A decade ago, it was only 4%. When the next recession hits, that number could take another spike upward.Employers, we're constantly told, offer health insurance to stay competitive in the race to recruit and retain workers. But putting people in a high-deductible plan alters that equation, since few employers fully fund the health savings accounts attached to such plans. If it's going to be my skin, I want it to be my plan.That loyalty (some call it job lock) will be further eroded by the Cadillac tax , which Congress and the White House last year postponed until 2020. Current government estimates say about 7% of people enrolled in employer-sponsored coverage will get hit by the tax, a number that will gradually rise.The whole point of the tax is to get employers to redesign plans to make beneficiaries more cost conscious. Therefore, its impact on loyalty will be the same as the rise of high-deductible plansit will make people more aware that health insurance is their responsibility, not their employers'.The rise of private exchanges is helping pave the way for the working population to accept a changed paradigm. While only 2% of covered workers in firms with over 50 employees use private exchanges, 17% are considering it, including 22% of employers with over 5,000 employees. Sen. Ted Cruz , now a front-runner in the race for the Republican nomination for president, has all but called for an end to employer-based health insurance. He couples that with ending essential benefits, ending government-run exchanges, and promoting a race to the bottom on state-based insurance regulationa disastrous set of policies for anyone concerned about overall health outcomes.But he's on to something when he calls for portability and individual responsibility. What he forgets is that Americans also yearn for security.The exchangesas long as they sell well-regulated policies that are affordablecan provide that security. The secret is including everyone in the pool. A careful read of this week's By the Numbers shows just as many countries achieve universal coverage through regulated insurance markets as through a single-payer system. Neither is better at controlling costs.We can pave the way for the gradual erosion of employer-based insurance by adopting policies that encourage individuals' use of exchanges. First, we need to shore them up by forcing Congress to fully fund the risk-adjustment program. The government needs to persuade younger, healthier people to purchase coverage.We shouldn't simply adjust the Cadillac tax, as President Barack Obama will recommend in his 2017 budget. We need to revamp the entire health insurance tax exclusion in a way that ties subsidies to income, and addresses all the reasons some plans are more expensive than others. That can be caused by the makeup of the risk pool and regional variations in the cost of care, as well as the generosity of plans.If Donald Trump's candidacy has taught us anything, it's that we're in a political period when traditional loyalties are breaking down. The same is true for the relationship between healthcare consumers and employer-based coverage.To loosely borrow from a song used in a previous political campaign: Let's start thinking about tomorrow.

Jocelyn Briddell remembers feeling paralyzed several years ago during a dinner conversation with co-workers at a colleagues home that took on an unexpected racial overtone.<br><br>Over an elaborate homemade Italian spread, her colleagues husband launched into a lengthy monologue in which he denigrated Jews, Latinos, African-Americans, Mexicans and lesbians  despite having guests that included two Jewish women, a lesbian and Briddell, who is African-American.<br><br>We were all just sitting there looking at one another, frozen, Briddell says. Finally after an hour and a half Briddell went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror, thinking what are you doing? She and her co-workers left, drove a block away and got out of their cars to talk about what happened.<br><br>We were stunned at ourselves for not saying anything, says Briddell, now executive director at the Scarritt Bennett Center in Nashville, which promotes racial justice through trainings and conferences.<br><br>Everyone goes through this when theyre sitting at the dinner table with family and friends and you think you'll just let that comment go, because its a social gathering, says Briddell.<br><br>For me it was a defining moment. I will never again not speak up. I could have told him it was offensive. I could have asked questions about why he was making those comments. But I didnt.<br><br>In recent years, there have been calls for a national dialogue about race and racism, prompted by everything from police-involved shootings of African Americans to the lack of diversity in Oscar nominations to Beyonces Super Bowl half-time show and her song, Formation.<br><br>But often, those conversations in day-to-day life can be awkward and uncomfortable.<br><br>Rinku Sen, president and executive director of Race Forward: The Center for Racial Justice Innovation and publisher of news site Colorlines, says that sometimes the best way to begin a conversation about race is by asking lots of questions.<br><br>A few years ago, Sen was waiting in line at the Sundance Film Festival to buy tickets. Sen, who is Indian-American, began chatting with a white woman behind her. The woman told her she had adopted two African-American sons. Sen told her she did racial justice work.<br><br>The woman told Sen that she had attended a two- or three-day race workshop and felt like she was hated by all the people of color there.<br><br>If I hear white privilege one more time, Im going to hurt someone, the woman told Sen. For Sen, whose career is devoted to openly talking about white privilege  the notion that white people have inherent advantages in American society  the response was offensive.<br><br>There were many, many times I wanted to roll my eyes during that conversation, Sen says. But the interesting thing I noted as we wound our way closer to the frontis that shed say something not so great and, then, if I asked her a question, shed talk her way in my direction, philosophically speaking. At one point, she said she felt that white people see themselves as individuals, and blacks and Latinos see themselves in groups. I said, you know why that is, dont you? And she said because we get to live as individuals, whereas they are always lumped in with their group.<br><br>For people of color who may be offended or angered by anothers remarks, Sens advice is to lower the litmus test. Expect people to be less than perfect. People are going to say the wrong things. Theyre going to be imperfect. Theyre not going to know a piece of history thats critical to your family.<br><br>Even if someone ultimately says the wrong thing, the fact they are willing to engage in conversation is important, she said.<br><br>Derald Wing Sue, a professor of education and psychology at Columbia Universitys Teachers College and author of the book Race Talk and the Conspiracy of Silence: Understanding and Facilitating Difficult Dialogues on Race,&nbsp;says even when conversations take a turn for the worse, he tries to keep dialogue open.<br><br>Sue, who is Asian American, recalled an interaction with a white female student in his class who interrupted him while he was talking about race.<br><br>The woman challenged Sue, pointing out that women are oppressed, too. She was uncomfortable and resistant, almost as if she felt like Sue was accusing white students of racism, he said.<br><br>When these interactions happen, I will generally agree, Sue said. Women are also a marginalized group in our society. But then I made a process observation. I told her, youre right about that, but you seem so upset and angry. Where is that coming from?<br><br>Eventually we got to the point that she understood what racism was about because as a woman, she had experienced the same things as well, Sue says. When we get to the point we can talk about what buttons we are pushing, then we can really hear one another.<br><br>Rev. William Barber, president of the North Carolina state chapter of the NAACP and author of The Third Reconstruction,&nbsp;says sometimes the most productive conversations about race dont focus on skin color, but the broader class divisions and societal problems  issues such as police brutality, access to healthcare and childcare, voting rights and economic inequality.<br><br>Barbers work promoting interracial dialogue within North Carolina communities has led to the creation of seven local chapters of National Association for the Advancement of Colored People that are predominantly white  and a recognition by some in those communities that Barber is representing interests that cross racial lines.<br><br>When you deal with race from systemic perspectives and examine disparities, you can show how policies that disparately hurt black people end up hurting us all, he says.<br><br>For Briddell, one of the biggest bridge-builders is to tell personal stories so people can see how their upbringings and lives are shaped differently by race.<br><br>Briddell had a conversation recently with a white co-worker who talked about his experience going to Ocean City in New Jersey as a child.<br><br>Briddell, whose family lives in the area, told him about her dad, an African-American who could not visit Ocean City. The only African-Americans who went to Ocean City in the 1940s and 1950s were gardeners, housekeepers or kitchen workers.<br><br>My coworker told me how much he appreciated my personal experience, because it made him think about how our lives were shaped differently because of racism, she says. He said there are places I have been going to all my life and never thought about this.<br><br>So how do you have a conversation about race?<br><br>&nbsp;Ask questions rather than make assertions, so you can understand why someone holds certain beliefs or opinions.<br><br>&nbsp;Tell personal stories about your life experiences and listen to how they differ from others.<br><br>&nbsp;Temper your reaction if someone says something that offends you, but try to acknowledge the impact of their words as quickly as possible. Take a break from the conversation if necessary and walk around the block. You cant calmly respond if you are too filled with emotion to articulate why.<br><br>&nbsp;Take a deep breath and don't freeze when conversations turn awkward or uncomfortable.<br><br>&nbsp;Talk about policies and larger system-wide issues that may disproportionately affect people of color but have a wider impact on the entire community.<br><br>&nbsp;Take a chance even if it makes you uncomfortable. If you make a mistake, youll get the chance to have another conversation. Just a willingness to begin the discussion is an important step.<br><br>&nbsp;For people of color, lower the litmus test. People are going to make mistakes and they are going to say the wrong thing. Expect people to be less than perfect, but remain engaged in the conversation.<br><br>&nbsp;Focus on the impact of peoples words and not the intentions behind them. People say racist things with intention and without intention.<br><br>&nbsp;Educate yourself. There are thoughtful analyses and stories available for everyone to read.<br><br>&nbsp;Any opportunity is a good opportunity to talk about race, not just tragedies. Big national stories often spark conversation but there is a version of that big national story probably going on near you.

The most common type of <a href="http://infection.omicsgroup.com/europe/call-for-abstracts.php">viral disease</a>&nbsp;is the common cold, which is caused by a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract (nose and throat). <a href="http://infection.omicsgroup.com/europe/">Viral diseases</a>&nbsp;are contagious and spread from person to person when a virus enters the body and begins to multiply.

Most bacteria won't hurt you - less than 1 percent of the different types make people sick. Many are helpful. Some bacteria help to digest food, destroy disease-causing cells, and give the body needed vitamins.

Many parasites do not cause<a href="http://infection.omicsgroup.com/europe/call-for-abstracts.php">diseases</a>. Parasitic diseases can affect practically all living organisms, including plants and mammals. The study of parasitic diseases is called parasitology. Some parasites like Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium spp. can cause disease directly, but other organisms can cause disease by the toxins that they produce. Although organisms such as bacteria function as parasites, the usage of the term "<a href="http://infection.omicsgroup.com/europe/">parasitic disease</a>" is usually more restricted. The three main types of organisms causing these conditions are <a href="http://infection.omicsgroup.com/europe/">protozoa</a>&nbsp;(causing protozoan infection), helminths (helminthiasis), and ectoparasites. Protozoa and helminths are usually endoparasites (usually living inside the body of the host), while ectoparasites usually live on the surface of the host. Occasionally the definition of "<a href="http://infection.omicsgroup.com/europe/call-for-abstracts.php">parasitic disease</a>" is restricted to diseases due to endoparasites. </p>

<p>Players just starting out in the world of Blade and Soul could end up getting left in the dust if certain steps are not taken. To become one of the greatest players in Blade and Soul, it's important to get the best gear, soul shields, weapon, accessories and more. And of cause, you need to be max level. Every player realizes just how long it takes to get to that point in the game and it feels like an eternity. Although the PvE might be great, before players finally reach max level, they are left feeling overly tired of the game and chances are they will end up quitting before they reach the finer points of Blade and Soul.</p><p>All players know that to get the best equipment in game, they need <a href="http://www.bladesoulgold.net/" target="_blank">blade and soul gold</a> and lots of it. Players can get their hands on some gold by simply killing enemies, doing quests which usually has pretty good returns on gold, trading. The most preferred method for gaining gold is camping doing PvE but grinding for a long period of time for that gold, will become a long a tedious journey. Simply put, grinding is NO FUN at all. A lot of players will start with their friends being close to max level. Doing PvP any level earlier than that level 50 mark is not an enjoyable experience and PvP is what really hits home with Blade and Soul.</p><p>While you are grinding over and over to reach enough gold to get weapons you need for leveling, other players are having a much better experience doing endgame content and PvP. Wouldn't you like to know an easier way to get the gold your heart desires? Wouldn't you like to be the player that others are becoming envious over? Of course you would. Players shouldn't feel the need to waste their precious time that they will never, ever get back. Players shouldn't feel bored or aggravated at the game they love, they should feel exhilarated, get lost in the game and have fun! Should you find that grinding repeatedly for hours on end, not knowing exactly how much gold you will find just isn't your ideal of a "fun" time, why not purchase some Blade and Soul gold!</p><p>Purchasing the gold will not only enhance the fun factor knowing that you will never have to grind for what you want, but will also allow you to spend more time exploring the finer points of Blade and Soul!

<p><b>The world is changing</b>. The way people are perceiving and analysing things is changing. Everyday more and more people are getting online, changing the dynamics of marketing incredibly. Marketing is not about Billboards and Television Ads anymore, it is about being visible to your customer in their research phase. In pursuit of achieving these objectives, Organisations around the world have realised that Online Marketing (also referred to as Digital Marketing) is the most powerful and effective way of Marketing. <a href="http://www.infinityreach.com" target="_blank" title="Link: http://www.infinityreach.com">Digital Marketing</a> has found its Rightful place in the Western and the European markets but in India it is still at a very nascent stage and is a much undervalued form of Marketing.</p><p>WHY is it that every small firm in the West has a presence online but the biggest organisations in India still dont have a Facebook page? A laymans response would be "Perception and the Attitude of the Organisations in the subcontinent should change", if we analyse extensively, this is absolutely true. It is a well-known fact that big Organisations have shut down as they were not able to reach the right customers due to ineffective and unplanned Marketing Campaigns. But slowly and surely the shift from conventional marketing to Online Marketing is happening as the firms are understanding the value of Digital Marketing. In Hindsight, companies are going to spend more on Online Marketing Vis a Vis Conventional Marketing as they are realising the true potential and reach of Online Marketing.</p><p>A few Metros in India like Mumbai, Bengaluru and Delhi have been among the early adopters to this paradigm shift and have contributed hugely to where Digital Marketing is placed currently in India. The early bird Digital Marketing Agencies from these cities have made inroads into MNCs and have to an extent transformed the way Organisations have looked upon Marketing for Decades. These inroads have opened a huge potential market for Digital Marketing Agencies and have resulted in a huge splurge of these agencies in other Metros like Hyderabad and Tier1 cities like Pune.</p><p>Although Organisations and Marketing Heads have come to realise the importance of Digital Marketing for their survival in this competitive world, in Hyderabad most of the firms still undervalue this platform of Marketing and in Reality they treat it like a minute part of Conventional Marketing. The reason being they are still not completely aware of the widespread reach and the effectiveness of Digital Marketing. Lets look at this case study about a Big Organisation and how initially they were very skeptical about Digital Marketing but in due course of time they realised its potential and currently spend 10 fold more than what they initially started off with:</p><p><a href="http://smrholdings.in/" target="_blank">SMR Holdings</a> Case Study: A 25 year old Infrastructure firm known for building some of the biggest projects in Hyderabad and Bengaluru. Every year they spend heavily on conventional Marketing like Billboards and Paper Ads. They signed up with Infinity Reach a couple of months back and initially gave us a meagre spending budget, and we completely revamped their website, created new landing pages, new Facebook page, started smart SEO and spent wisely on Google AdWords, which in just a few months time started showing quantifying results. The Firm started recognising the impact of Digital Marketing on their business and completely transformed their Marketing strategy. They have seen a considerable increase in the number of sales and as they say the rest is history.</p><p>Organisations, CEOs and the Marketing Heads located in the Pearl City are yet to recognise the true potential of Digital Marketing. So will they do that in the near future? Well only TIME can tell. But one fact is very certain that current Organisations should learn from the past debacles of big Organisations and realise the potential of Digital Marketing and give its due credit.</p><p> </p><p><br></p>

This section addresses how different groupsoncologists, patients, and  Nursesthink about end-of-life care issues. This section discusses an  oncologists responsibility and perspective when it comes to difficult  subjects such as advanced cancer, hospice, do not resuscitate orders, <a href="http://www.omicsonline.org/scholarly/cytotoxic-drugs-journals-articles-ppts-list.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">cytotoxic</a>  therapy, supportive care, maintaining a patients dignity, and imminent  death. Articles in this series also discuss the role of spirituality  and religion at the time of death, and the importance of good  communication between the oncologist and family members throughout the  dying process.Oncology nurses practice in a variety of settings  including acute care hospitals, ambulatory care clinics, private  oncologists offices, radiation therapy facilities, home healthcare  agencies, and community agencies. The roles of the oncology nurses vary  from the intensive care focus of bone marrow transplantation to the  community focus of cancer screening, detection, and prevention. <a href="http://oncology.nursingconference.com/call-for-abstracts.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Health promotion</a>  includes motivating people to embrace behaviors that both improve their  emotional and physical quality of life and reduce their risk for  premature morbidity and mortality. Although the majority of adults  treated for cancer in the United States live free of disease for many  years, many survivors experience lasting side effects and complications  of treatment. Others encounter recurrences or new cancers that require  additional treatment. <a href="http://oncology.nursingconference.com/call-for-abstracts.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Late effects</a>  vary from one cancer survivor to the next. They can range from very  mild to serious. Medical experts cant always predict if or when they  will occur. Some effects might improve or go away with time such as  anemia. Patients with advanced cancer are willing to pay more for all  aspects of a good <a href="http://oncology.nursingconference.com/call-for-abstracts.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">end-of-life</a>  experience compared with healthy older adults. Both groups are willing  to pay more to be pain free and to die at home.

Designed as a pure software solution, C4S can be easily deployed and integrated with existing cloud services and/or private content servers. Streambolico has conducted extensive lab and field trials in 18 countries, which have shown the tremendous potential of C4S to speed up mobile file transfers, and is now looking for partners with interest in the technology to participate in the validation of the potential of C4S via pilot deployments.</p><p>TCP, the commonly used protocol for file transfers, does not serve mobile devices well.&nbsp; Packet loss and jitter are common in wireless networks, due to shadowing, fading and interference, slowing file transfers. Streambolicos C4S file transfer solution overcomes these issues. <i>Using a unique network coding protocol coupled with an advanced rate control mechanism, C4S achieves reliable and up to 10x faster file transfer to and from mobile devices</i>, according to Rui Costa, CEO of Streambolico.</p><p>      </p><p>The new C4S file transfer solution employs a client-server architecture, suitable for fast integration with both cloud and private servers, and includes a software developers kit (SDK) for Android and iOS, allowing enterprises and businesses to integrate C4S within their existing applications.</p><p>Read more in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.streambolico.com" target="_blank">http://www.streambolico.com/</a> </p>

<p>These are both 6-man dungeons with 4-man heroic versions. Be advised that the heroic versions do not give you warnings on boss mechanics. Do not do the 4-man versions of these dungeons until you are very comfortable in the 6-man dungeon AND you have a decent Soul Shield set. These dungeons require that your weapon is upgraded to at least Awakened Profane. I recommend having at least 25k health from soul shields before attempting these dungeons. 2-3 <a href="http://www.bladesoulgold.net/" target="_blank">BNS Gold</a>, Soul Shield Chests, Boss Loot (Outfits, Soul Shields, Crafting Materials)</p><p>It's okay to admit if it's your first time in one of these dungeons. Most players are more than happy to help someone new. It's better for the party to know that you're inexperienced than for them to assume you know what you're doing and then fail at it.</p><p>Do NOT, I repeat, DO NOT USE SKILLS THAT KNOCK A TARGET AIRBORNE. These skills are great for PvP but will waste everyone's time in a dungeon, since if you knocked a target airborne, you are the only person who can DPS that target until they land.</p><p>Grappling skills, such as the one that KFMs have, are great. These do not restrict party DPS.</p><p>4 bosses in each dungeon. Bloodshade Harbor is more difficult than Blackram Supply Chain.</p><p>There are separate dailies for 6-man dungeons and 4-man dungeons. If you complete the 6-man quest for a dungeon, you cannot also complete the 4-man quest for the dungeon. The 4-man quest gives greater rewards, but do not attempt them until you are very comfortable with the dungeon.</p><p>You must do the quest "Invitation from Poharan" before you can queue for Blackram Supply Chain. You must also have at least an Awakened Profane weapon.</p><p>Bloodshade Harbor's cross-server daily will not appear until you have completed "Reunion at Bloodshade Harbor", a regular blue quest in the Fishing Lodge, which is a windstride point in the Moonwater Plains-Hogshead Pasture, just south of Hogshead Hamlet. In turn, "Reunion at Bloodshade Harbor" will not appear until you have completed the 6-man Blackram Supply daily at least once. Thanks /u/shiror, /u/TESS3RA, /u/deice3, and /u/Ecorin</p><p>Make sure to accept the dailies from the Cross Server NPC before entering.</p><p>Nothing special, just defeat all the bosses within each dungeon for rewards.</p><p>If you are unsure on boss mechanics, they are almost the exact same bosses as in the 24-man world raids.</p><p>Takes about 30 minutes for each dungeon assuming no wipes and experienced party members.</p><p>For more information, please go to <a href="http://www.bladesoulgold.net" title="Link: http://www.bladesoulgold.net">http://www.bladesoulgold.net</a></p>

<h2>An Open Question</h2><p>Every field has one. A problem that has been written off as too difficult, too time consuming. Merely mentioning an attempt to solve it raises eyebrows. Long after the community at large has moved on, it is taken up by those on the fringe. Attempts by novices are undertaken for no other reason than the difficulty of the problem and the imagined accolades that would accompany a solution. The open question in Computer Science of whether P = NP is such a problem. An answer to the affirmative has the possibility to literally change the world, provided a "reasonable" polynomial time algorithm is presented. Python's hardest problem is less difficult than crafting a proof of P = NP, to be sure. Nevertheless, it has not received a satisfactory solution to date, and the practical implications of a solution would be similarly transformative. Thus, it's easy to see why so many in the Python community are interested in an answer to the question: "What can be done about the Global Interpreter Lock?"</p><h2>A Low Level Look at Python</h2><p>To understand the GIL and its implications, we must start at Python's foundations. Languages like C++ are compiled languages, so named because a program is fed in to a compiler where it is parsed according to the language's grammar, transformed into a language agnostic intermediate representation, and linked into an executable comprised of highly optimized machine code. The compiler is able to optimize the code so aggressively because it is seeing the whole program (or large, self-contained chunks) at once. This allows it to reason about interactions between different language constructs and make informed decisions about optimization.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, Python is an interpreted language. The program is fed into an&nbsp;interpreter&nbsp;in order to be run. The interpreter has no knowledge of the program before it is run; rather, it knows the rules of Python and is capable of dynamically applying those rules. It too has optimizations, but optimizations of a rather different class. Since the interpreter cannot reason about the program proper, most of Python's optimizations are optimizations of the interpreter itself. A faster interpreter means faster program execution "for free". That is, when the interpreter is optimized, Python programs need not change to realize the benefit.&nbsp;</p><p>This is an important point, so it bears repeating. The execution speed of a Python program, all other things being equal, is directly tied to the "speed" of the interpreter. No matter how much optimization you do within your program itself, your program's execution speed is still tied to how efficiently the interpreter can execute your code. It is clear, then, why much work has been devoted to optimizing the Python interpreter. It is the closest thing to a free lunch Python programmers can get.</p><h2>The Free Lunch Is Over</h2><p>Or is it? A generation of programmers have learned to write code while Moore's Law was delivering hardware based speedups with predictable timing. If one wrote code that was slow, simply waiting a bit for faster processors was oftentimes the easiest solution. Indeed, Moore's law still holds true and likely will for quite a bit longer, but the&nbsp;way&nbsp;in which it holds has fundamentally changed. No longer are clock rates steadily increasing to dizzying speeds. Instead,&nbsp;multiple cores&nbsp;are used to take advantage of transistor density increases. Programs wishing to capitalize on new processors must be rewritten to exploit&nbsp;parallelism.</p><p>When most developers hear "parallelism" the immediately think of multi-threaded programs. Utilizing multiple threads of execution is by far the most common way to take advantage of multi-core systems. While multi-threaded programming is a good deal tougher than "sequential" programming, the careful programmer may nevertheless exploit parallelizable portions of his or her code to great effect. The implementation language should be an afterthought, since almost all heavily used modern languages support multi-threaded programming.&nbsp;</p><h2>A Surprising Fact</h2><p>Now we come to the crux of the issue. To take advantage of multi-core systems, Python must support multiple threads of execution. Being an interpreted language, Python's&nbsp;interpreter&nbsp;must be written in such a way so that doing so is both safe and performant. We all know the issues that multi-threaded programming can present. The interpreter must be mindful not to operate on internally shared data from different threads. It must also manage user's threads in such a way that the maximum amount of computation is being performed at all times.</p><p>What, then, is the mechanism by which data is protected from simultaneous access by different threads? The&nbsp;Global Interpreter Lock. The name is instructive. Quite literally, it is a global (in the sense of the interpreter) lock (in the sense of a mutex or similar construct) on the interpreter. This approach is certainly safe, but it has (for the new Python programmer), a startling implication: in any Python program, no matter how many threads and how many processors are present,&nbsp;only one thread is being executed at any time.</p><p>Many discover this fact by accident. Newsgroups and message boards are littered with messages from Python novices and experts alike asking "why does my newly multi-threaded Python program run slower than when it had only one thread?" Many feel silly even asking the question, since of course a program with two threads where before there was just one will be faster (assuming that the work is indeed parallelizable). In fact, the question is asked so frequently that Python experts have crafted a standard answer: "Do not use multiple threads. Use multiple processes." But this answer is even more confusing than its question. I shouldn't use multiple threads in Python? How can multi-threading in a language as popular as Python be so broken as to have experts recommending against its use? Surely I'm missing something?</p><p>Sadly, nothing has been missed. Due to the design of the Python interpreter, using multiple threads to increase performance is at best a difficult task. At worst, it will&nbsp;decrease&nbsp;(sometimes significantly) the speed of your program. A freshman CS undergrad could tell you what to expect when threads are all competing for a single shared resource. The results are often not pretty. That said, there are many times that multi-threading works well, and it is perhaps a testament to both the interpreter implementation and the core developers that there are not more complaints about Python's multi-threading performance.</p><h2>What Now? Panic?</h2><p>So what, then, can be done? Are we as Python developers meant to give up the idea of using multiple threads to exploit parallelism? Why does the GIL need to guarantee only one thread is running at a time anyway? Couldn't finer-grained locks be added to protect individual objects from simultaneous access? And why has no one attempted something like this before?</p><p>These are useful questions with interesting answers. The GIL protects access to things like the current thread state and heap allocated object for garbage collection. There is nothing special about the Python language, however, that&nbsp;requires&nbsp;the use of a GIL. It is an artifact of the implementation. There are alternative Python interpreters (and compilers) that do not make use of a GIL. For CPython, though, it's been there pretty much since the beginning.</p><p>So why not get rid of it? Many are not aware, but this was attempted back in 1999 for Python 1.5 in the oft-cited but poorly understood "free threading" patches from Greg Stein. In the patches, the GIL was completely removed and replaced with finer grained locking. Its removal, however, came at the expense of execution speed for single-threaded programs. It was perhaps 40% slower when running with a single thread. Two threads showed an increase in speed, but beyond that the benefits did not scale linearly with the number of cores. Because of the degradation in execution speed, the patches were rejected and largely forgotten.</p><h2>The GIL is Hard. Let's Go Shopping!</h2><p>The "free threading" patches are instructive, though, in that they demonstrate a fundamental point about the Python interpreter: removing the GIL is&nbsp;hard. Since the time of the patches, the interpreter has come to rely on&nbsp;more&nbsp;global state, making the removal of today's GIL that much more difficult. It should be noted that it is precisely for this reason that many become interested in attempting to remove the GIL in the first place; hard problems are fun.</p><p>But perhaps this is all a bit misguided. Let's consider what would happen if we had a magical patch that removed the GIL with no performance penalty to single threaded Python code. We would have what we said we wanted all along: a threading API that properly makes use of all processors simultaneously. Now that we've got what we want, is it actually a good thing?</p><p>Thread based programming is hard. There are no two ways about it. Every time one thinks he or she understands everything there is to know about how threading works, a new wrinkle is uncovered. A number of high-profile language designers and researchers have come out against the threading model because it is simply too difficult to get right with any reasonable degree of consistency. As anyone who has written a multi-threaded application can tell you, both developing and debugging are exponentially more difficult compared to a single threaded program. The programmer's mental model, while well suited for sequential programs, just doesn't match the parallel execution model. The GIL, then, unintentionally serves to help protect a programmer from his or her self. While synchronization primitives are still required when using threads, the GIL actually helps preserve consistency of data between threads.</p><p>It seems, then, that Python's most difficult question may be asking the wrong thing. There's a good reason that Python experts recommend using multiple processes instead of multiple threads, and it's not to hide the inadequacies of the Python threading implementation. Rather, it is to encourage developers to use a safer and more straightforward concurrency model and reserve multi-threaded programming for when it is absolutely necessary. To many, it is not clear what, if any, is the "best" model for parallel programming. What is clear to most, however, is multiple threads is not it.</p><p>As for the GIL, don't think it just sits there static and unanalyzed. Python 3.2 saw a new GIL implementation by Antoine Pitrou with encouraging results. It was the first major change to the GIL since 1992. The change is too large to explain here, but at a high level, the old GIL counted Python instructions to determine when it was time to give up the GIL. As it turns out, a single Python instruction can comprise a large amount of work, as they don't translate 1:1 to machine instructions. In the new GIL, a hard timeout is used to instruct the current thread to give up the lock. When a second thread requests the lock, the thread currently holding it is compelled to release it after 5ms (that is, it checks if it needs to release it every 5ms). This leads to more predictable switching between threads when work is available.&nbsp;</p><p>It is not a perfect change, however. Perhaps the most active researcher into the effect of the GIL on various types of work is David Beazley. In addition to what is likely the most in-depth look at the pre-3.2 GIL, he has researched the new GIL implementation and discovered a number of interesting program profiles for which even the new GIL performs quite poorly. He continues to drive the discussion surrounding the GIL forward with practical research and published results.</p><p>Regardless of one's personal feelings about Python's Global Interpreter Lock, it remains the language's most difficult technical challenge. To understand its implications requires a thorough understanding of operating system design, multi-threaded programming, C, interpreter design, and the CPython interpreter implementation. Those prerequisites alone preclude many developers from investigating it more thoroughly. Nevertheless, the GIL shows no signs of going away any time soon. For the time being, it will continue to both confuse and surprise those new to the language while simultaneously intriguing those interested in trying to solve very difficult technical problems.</p><p>The preceding is based on my research to date into the Python interpreter. While there are many other parts of the interpreter I hope to write about, none is more well known than the Global Interpreter Lock. The technical details were researched thoroughly against the CPython repository tip, though I imagine there are some inaccuracies. If you spot one, please let me know so that I may correct it as quickly as possible.</p><p>Posted on&nbsp;Mar 31, 2012&nbsp;by&nbsp;Jeff Knupp<br></p>

These results were then adjusted to account for individual candidate trends, projections of voter participation, and allocation of undecided voters.

The prediction and results, as published prior to the election, were as follows:</p><table>  <tbody><tr>   <td>   <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PREDICTION   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ACTUAL</p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td>   <p>Trump   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 33%   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;33%</p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td>   <p>Rubio   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;20%   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;22%</p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td>   <p>Cruz   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 19%   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 22%</p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td>   <p>Kasich   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;12%   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8%</p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td>   <p>Bush   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10%   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    8%</p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td>   <p>Carson   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6%   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7%</p>   </td>  </tr> </tbody></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1World's research team, led by Chief Research Officer (and University of South Carolina Journalism Professor) Dr. Augie Grant, conducted an analysis that combined the results of 15 selected polls conducted among South Carolina voters since February 1st. The results from each poll were weighted to adjust for sample size and response rate. These results were then adjusted to account for individual candidate trends, projections of voter participation, and allocation of undecided voters. As a combination of weighted results that includes projections regarding undecided voters and short-term trends, the margin of error can't be determined; but, what you end up with is a simple, numerical projection of the final South Carolina vote count.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1World methodology includes spot polling on trending aspects of a campaign using its innovative digital intelligence platform, which includes tools for polling, surveying, quizzes, debates, and analytics. In this primary race, 1World introduces 1PoP, a new Poll of <a>Polls</a><a href="#_msocom_1">[JN1]</a>&nbsp; methodology. Weighted adjustment and spot polling are also used as needed. The next 1World prediction is scheduled for the South Carolina Democratic primary election on February 27th.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of the 45 polls captured for this Republican primary election in South Carolina, closeness was measured as a sum of the squared deviations. This measure showed 1World was a close second to Emerson University, but Emerson incorrectly picked Cruz to finish <a>second</a>, ahead of Rubio<a href="#_msocom_2">[JN2]</a>&nbsp;. Polling, whether it is for political elections or for corporate research, has become a very difficult proposition, said Dr. Grant, It takes cutting edge research and listening to signals others might miss to make accurate predictions today.</p><p>                                      </p><div>      <div>  <div><a></a>  <p>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_1">[JN1]</a>Poll of Poll OR Poll of Polls?</p>  </div>  </div>  <div>  <div><a></a>  <p>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_2">[JN2]</a>This paragraph does not make sense to me.
